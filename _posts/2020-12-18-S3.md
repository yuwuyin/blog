# Sessions 3-4 Where to Compete

## A market-based view (MBV) of strategy
- A focus on the **external** context and its importance as a determinant of **organizational strategy** is often referred to as a market-based view (MBV) of strategy.
- It is also known as an '**outside-in**' perspective on strategy and organizational performance.
- The MBV has roots in **industrial economics theory**, which holds that *the position an organization adopts in the minds of its customers*, relative to its competitors, will be a key determinant of its survival and success in the long run.

## The Competitive Environment

## Macro-environmental influences: the PESTEL framework
- **Political**
	
	- Government stability
	- Taxation policy
	- Foreign trade regulations
	- Social welfare policies
	
- **Environmental**
	
	- Environmental protection laws
	- Waste disposal
	
- **Socio-cultural factors**
	
	- Population demographics
	- Income distribution
	- Social mobility
	- Lifestyle changes
	- Attitudes to work and leisure
	- Consumerism
	- Levels of education
	
- **Technological**
	
	- Government spending on research
	- Government and industry focus on technological effort
	
	- New discoveries/development
	- Speed of technology transfer
	- Rates of obsolescence
	
- **Economic factors**
	
	- Business cycles
	- GNP trends
	- Interest rates
	- Money supply
	- Inflation
	- Unemployment
	- Disposable income
	
- **Legal**
	
	- Monopolies legislation
	- Employment law
	- Health and safety
	- Product safety
	
	## Porter's 5 Forces
	
	- Michael Porter and industry structure
	- Essence of strategy formulation is coping with the competition….but it goes further than other competitors - also competing with suppliers and customers for negotiating power
	- The state of competition depends on five forces which determine the industry’s profit potential:
		- Weak forces – superior profits
		- Strong forces – poor profits
	- Companies must understand the forces in order to find a position where they can defend against or influence the key competitive forces.

### Industry Structure – Five Forces
- Determinants of **New Entry Threat**
	- Capital requirements 
	- Economies of scale
	- Absolute cost advantages
		- learning curve effects
	- Product differentiation 
	- Access to distribution channels
	- Legislation
	
- Determinants of **Supplier Power**
	- Supplier concentration
	- Importance of volume to supplier
	- Switching costs
	- Presence of substitute inputs
	- Threat of forward integration
	
- Determinants of **Buyer Power**
	- Bargaining leverage
	- Buyer concentration versus firm concentration
	- Buyer volume
	- Buyer information
	- Buyer switching costs
	- Ability to backward integrate
	- Price sensitivity
	- Fraction of buyer's costs
	- Importance to buyers quality
	- Buyer's own margin position
	
- Determinants of **Substitution Threat**
	- Relative price performance
	- Switching costs
	- Buyer propensity to substitute
	
- **Rivalry** Determinants
	
	- No/balance of competitors
	- Industry growth rate
	- Fixed costs/overcapacity
	- Product differentiation
	- Exit barriers
	- Diversity of competitors
	
	### Limitations of Five Forces analysis
	- Five Forces is too **static** – it’s a **snapshot**. 
	- Five Forces insights are **highly dependent on** where the **market/industry boundaries** are drawn.
	- Five Forces **ignores the effects of non-competitive products and services** that influence profitability - focuses attention on the direct supplier, buyer, and competitor relationships in a specific market.
	- Five Forces analysis doesn’t take into consideration the **potential importance** of regulations and their impact on the markets/industry.

## Defining the industry 
- Is difficult but crucial
- An industry is **a group of firms** producing **products** which are **close substitutes** for each other
- Who **buyers** see as competitors - does this differ on occasions or in different contexts?
- **Geographical** limits to competition - is this a local, national, global industry/market ?
- **Industry value chain**, where does the **power** lie?

## Basic Strategy Options from Industry Analysis
**Defend** - adopt a position within the industry that defends against (avoids) the strongest forces (e.g. target buyer groups with lower power)
**Influence** - pursue strategies that will in time change the balance of forces driving profitability in your favour (e.g. intra-industry M&A *(Merger and Acquisition)* to build critical mass to gain leverage over suppliers/buyers)
**Exploit** - adopt strategies which take advantage of changes in the nature of the forces (e.g. enter production of improved substitute product)

## Strategic group analysis
- Strategic group analysis **identifies direct competitors** that should be studied as part of micro-level analysis. 
- As reported by Cool and Schendel (1987), a strategic group is defined as **the collection of organizations** adopting broadly the **same strategy to service the needs of the same group of customers**. 
- Strategic groups can be identified by **mapping the position of competitors in an industry against two competitive criteria**.
