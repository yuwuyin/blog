# Introduction: Module structure and objectives

## Rationale

A crucial competence for general  managers is an understanding of marketing strategy: in simple terms,  analysing how a marketplace of customers can be divided into segments,  which of these segments are key targets for the firm, determining the  firm’s optimal value proposition for each segment, and what financial  and non-financial results can be expected over a planning period of  typically 1-3 years. This module teaches Cranfield’s world-leading  step-by-step process for developing such a marketing strategy and  documenting it in a marketing plan. This process has been developed with hundreds of blue-chip companies worldwide over the last 30 years,  informed by several Cranfield PhDs on the topic which have studied what  works in practice.

## Content

- Marketing Management in context
- 10 steps of the strategic marketing planning process
- Mission statements and organisational objectives
- The Marketing Audit and analytical tools
- Market maps and market segmentation
- SWOT analysis
- Marketing objectives and strategies
- Product and pricing strategy

## Intended Learning Outcomes:

### Knowledge and Understanding

As a result of this module, students will be able to:

- Understand the evolution and role of marketing and be able to describe the characteristics of a customer-centric organisation
- Appreciate a series of marketing tools and techniques and their application in practice
- Recognise a successful marketing planning process and understand the construction and evaluation of a strategic marketing plan

### Skills and Other Attributes

- At the end of this module students will be able to structure and  prepare a comprehensive marketing plan, both strategic and tactical.
- The intellectual skills developed in this module will also enable students to evaluate marketing plans prepared by others.

## Teaching & Learning Methods

Classes will consist of short conventional lectures followed by a  briefing session for hands-on planning exercises that students will  complete in their learning teams. To do this, students will be required  to carry out some on-line research.

A case study will be used as the basis for students to develop their  own versions of a possible marketing plan which will be broken down into stages and, at each stage, students will be asked to complete an  exercise and then return to present it in class, followed by a  discussion.

## What we expect from you

The work-load will be relatively heavy and you will need to organise  your reading and preparation time carefully. The normal expectation is  that you will spend at least twice as long on reading and preparation  outside class as in the class session itself. We expect you to read in  advance some specified pre-reading. Before the first session, this  includes the case study we will be using throughout the module. In  class, please contribute actively, and to be prepared to open the  discussion if called on. After class, there may be further work in  learning teams to schedule. However, we should add that we fully hope  and expect that you will enjoy yourself!

## Course Assessment & Integration

### Module Assessment

**Individual marketing plan**

Each student is asked to develop a strategic marketing plan for a  company, and one of its products in particular, of his or her choice.  The company should sell to consumers rather than other businesses.  Students are provided with a template for the plan.

**Group In-Class Presentation - does not contribute to the module mark**

In the final session of this module, each learning team will present  their analysis and recommendations for the company that you've been  working on. Each team will have a maximum 10 minutes to present.

# Session 5 - 8: The marketing audit (2): Market mapping and market segmentation

## Introduction

Dr Ahmed Shaalan

### Introduction

In these sessions, we emphasise the importance of customer insight in the development of marketing strategy. Initially, market mapping is  introduced as a tool for understanding market structure. Market  segmentation, based on needs, motivations and buyer behaviours is  introduced as a core marketing process and illustrated using examples of world-class practices.

### Session outline

- How to develop a market map
- How to approach segmenting markets.

# Session 9 - 12: Summarising the portfolio: Critical success factors, market attractiveness factors and the Directional Policy Matrix

## Introduction

Dr Ahmed Shaalan

### Introduction

These sessions show how to combine the previous steps of the process  into a summary of the current portfolio of product-markets, as a basis  for decisions about future resource allocation. Market Attractiveness  Factors (MAFs) help companies prioritise their markets. Critical Success Factors summarise how customers buy and so help summarise strengths and weaknesses. These are combined in a diagram called a Directional Policy Matrix to summarise the current portfolio.

### Session outline

- Market Attractiveness Factors (MAFs) and how to use them
- How to identify the critical factors (CSFs) in customers’ decision-making
- Producing a Directional Policy Matrix.

**Intended Learning Outcomes:**

The session will contribute to your understanding of marketing strategy by:

- Familiarisation with some core tools of strategic marketing planning: MAFs, CSFs and the DPM.
- Interpretation and understanding of the outputs of each of the tools.
- Understanding of how the tools build upon each to create an  evidence-based platform for the allocation of scarce resources amongst  competing ends.

### Readings
