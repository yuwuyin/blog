# Part 1. Introduction

***The nature of Strategic Marketing ; The planning process***

**Agenda**

- Marketing: its role and definitions
- The marketing planning process: an introduction
- Mission statement and corporate objectives

## 1. The nature of marketing management

### 1.1 Definition of Marketing

> “Marketing is the process of planning and executing the conception, pricing, promotion and distribution of goods, ideas and services to create exchanges that satisfy individual and organizational goals” 
>
> --1985 AMA Definition of Marketing 

- 4Ps: Product, Price, Place (distribution), Promotion 

### 1.2 A relationship perspective on how profits arise: The experience-profit chain 

(Wilson/Macdonald)

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_MKT/The experience-profit chain.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

### 1.3 Transactional Vs. Relational Marketing

| Transactional Focus                          | Relationship Focus               |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Focus on a single sale                       | Focus on customer retention      |
| Orientation on product features & benefits   | Orientation on customer benefits |
| Short time scale                             | Long time scale                  |
| Less emphasis on customer service            | High customer service emphasis   |
| Limited customer commitment                  | High customer commitment         |
| Moderate customer contact                    | High customer contact            |
| Quality is primarily a concern of production | Quality is the concern of all    |

> “Marketing is an organizational function and a set of processes for creating, communicating and delivering **value** to customers and for managing customer **relationships** in ways that benefit the organization and its stakeholders”
>
> -- 2004 AMA Definition of Marketing 

> “The activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large”
>
> -- 2009 AMA Definition of Marketing 

### 1.4 Conclusions

1. Marketing is about aligning what we have to offer with what the customer will perceive value from
2. This process may (or may not) be coordinated by marketing people, but will certainly involve others too
3. A relationship perspective is valuable in contexts (e.g. much of B2B) where customers perceive value from a longer-term relationship rather than discrete transactions
4. But maintaining relationships may incur costs, which are not always justified
5. Some extend the marketing definition to include relationships not just with customers but also with other stakeholders (influencers, society etc)

## 2. The Marketing Planning Process

### 2.1 The ten steps of the strategic marketing planning process

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_MKT/Planning process.png" alt="The ten steps of the strategic marketing planning process" style="zoom:50%;" />

### 2.2 The relationship between business planning, strategic marketing planning and tactical marketing planning

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_MKT/The relationship between business planning, strategic marketing planning and tactical marketing planning.png" alt="The relationship between business planning, strategic marketing planning and tactical marketing planning" style="zoom:50%;" />

### 2.3 Strategic marketing planning

#### Marketing plan points

- What is our purpose?
- What is our market?
- Who are our customers?
- What are our products/offerings?
- What does the customer need?
- How well do our products satisfy these needs?
- What are our objectives?
- How can we allocate our resources optimally?
- What are our strategies?
	- What new products should be developed?
	- How should we price our products?
	- What should our channel strategies be?
	- What service levels should we provide for our different customer groups?
	- How should we communicate with our target markets?
- How should we measure the effectiveness of our plan?

#### The contents of a strategic marketing plan 

(less than 20 pages)

- Mission statement
- Financial summary
- Market overview
- SWOT analyses
- Portfolio summary
- Assumptions
- Objectives and strategies
- Budget

### 2.4 Unit mission statement

The purpose of the mission statement is to state the reason of the business unit covered by the plan. Brief statements should be made which cover the following points:

| Points                              | Exp                                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Role or contribution of the unit | e.g. profit generator, service department, opportunity seeker |
| 2. Definition of the business       | e.g. the needs you satisfy or the benefit you provide. Don’t be too specific (e.g. ‘we sell milking machinery’) or too general (e.g. ‘we’re in the engineering business’). |
| 3. Distinctive competence           | A brief statement that applies only to your specific unit. A statement that could equally apply to any competitor is unsatisfactory. |
| 4. Indications for the future       | A brief statement of the principal things you would give serious consideration to (e.g. move into a new segment). |

*(Marketing Planning Process)***Step 1. **Defining a Market-Oriented Mission

Mission statement should be market (and not product)-oriented

*(Marketing Planning Process)***Step 2. **Corporate objectives

The purpose of corporate objectives is to agree where we are trying to get to. The rest of the plan determines how we will get there.

**SMART Objectives:** Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-based

## 1. Environment Audit

### 1.1 Environmental Scanning using PESTLE

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_MKT/PESTLE.png" style="zoom:48%;" />

### 1.2 Five Competitive Forces that Shape Strategy

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_MKT/Five Competitive Forces.png" style="zoom:38%;" />

**Force 1. The Threat Of New Entrants**

Entry Barriers:
- Economies of Scale
- Capital Requirements
- Switching Costs
- Access to Distribution
- Government Policy

**Force 2. The Bargaining Power Of Suppliers**

Determinants of Supplier Power:
- Many buyers and few suppliers
- Suppliers threaten to integrate forward into the industry (brand manufacturers threatening to set up their own retail outlets)
- Buyers do not threaten to integrate backward into the suppliers’ industry
- The industry is not a key customer group to the suppliers

**Force 3. The Bargaining Power Of Buyers**

Determinants of Buyer Power:
- Many sellers and few buyers
- Standardization of products
- Buyers threaten to integrate backwards into the industry
- Suppliers do not threaten to integrate forwards into the buyer’s industry
- The industry is not a key supplier group for buyers

**Force 4. The Threat Of Substitutes**

Determinants of Substitute Threat:
- Buyer’s willingness to substitute
- Relative price and performance of substitutes
- Costs of switching to substitutes

**Force 5. The Threat Of Industry Competitors**

- Structure of the Competition
- Structure of Costs
- Degree of Differentiation
- Switching Costs
- Strategic Objectives
- Exit Barriers

### 2.2 Boston matrix

#### Introduction

**Purpose:** helps firms allocate resources between competing opportunities (put on a 2 by 2)

**History:** Boston Consulting Group 1970s, GE McKinsey (3 by 3)

**Assumptions:** PLC (market growth), Learning curve - economies of scale (market share)

**Focus:** Cash management (cash proxy for resources)

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_MKT/BCG Matrix and generic strategies.png" style="zoom:48%;" />

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_MKT/BCG Matrix - Growth Share Matrix.png" style="zoom:48%;" />

**Unhealthy business portfolio when:**

- Too few: stars & cash cows
- Too many: question-marks & dogs

## 3. Market Segmentation & Perceptual Map

### 3.1 Segments

**Financials by segment**

- Financial Summary

- Why market growth rates are important

- Why we need financials by segment

**Definition:** A group of customers who share the same or similar needs

*Starting point for building competitive advantage*

**Criteria** for need-based segments:

- adequate size
- cluster principle: members similar and distinct from members of other segments 
- criteria for describing them must be relevant
- segments must be addressable

**Bases of segmentation**

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_MKT/Bases of segmentation.png" style="zoom:48%;" />

**How popular are different bases of segmentation?**

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_MKT/How popular are different bases of segmentation.png" style="zoom:48%;" />

**Segmentation: retirement income**

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_MKT/Segmentation - retirement income.png" style="zoom:48%;" />

**Six lifestyle segments**

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_MKT/Six lifestyle segments.png" style="zoom:48%;" />

### 3.2 Value-in-use

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_MKT/Value in use tool.png" style="zoom:48%;" />

### 3.3 Segmentation Method

#### Step 1. eliciting buying criteria

- Write down all of your customers’ buying criteria (refer back to the value-in-use analysis)
- Divide into two groups: 
	- Hygiene factors – essentials to be in the market
	- Motivators – desirables that contribute to decision on who to buy from
- Put a \* by those motivators on which customers vary (‘differentiating motivators’).

Exercise:

1. List of 9 value-in-use
2. Division of these into motivators and hygiene factors
3. Asterisks against important differentiators

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_MKT/export consultancy.png" style="zoom:48%;" />

#### Step 2. A simple segmentation

- Choose two motivators on which customers vary (‘differentiating motivators’)
	- Make sure they are independent of each other

- Make them the two axes of a ‘perceptual map’

- Think of some of your customers and where they appear on this map. Are there customers in all four corners? Can you think of four (or more or less) clusters of customers?
	- It often helps to think of specific, named customers
	- Give the segments descriptive labels

Exercise: Perceptual Map

### 3.4 Perceptual Map

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_MKT/Perceptual Map.png" style="zoom:48%;" />

**Refined:**<img src="/assets/img/Pic_MKT/Perceptual Map - refined.png" style="zoom:48%;" />

**After Session:** estimating segment size & our sales

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_MKT/estimating segment size & our sales.png" style="zoom:48%;" />

### 3.5 Academic Discussion

**What’s Changed, What’s Not**

Some things have changed very little….
**Basic purpose of segmentation is unchanged:**

- Managing (and meeting) diverse customer needs
- Targeting attractive prospects
- Effective allocation of marketing resources

> …the objective of marketing is to get and keep (the) customer, and that this is achieved by knowing what the customer wants, how (they) differ from one another and how these differences can be clustered into meaningful segments.
> -- Theodore Levitt (1983) 

**But some things have changed a lot….**


- Rise of customer insight/analytics & CRM 
- Changing shopping behaviour, including the Internet
- Social: New applications to ‘marketing the world a better place’

This has increased the scope & range of segmentation applications

**The Academic Perspective on Segmentation**

So how are these changes reflected in what academics have to say about segmentation?  

- Huge literature spanning fifty years, with a focus on statistical approaches & segment creation
- Technology developments have reinforced this, spawning new work around CRM, and customer value (retention & acquisition)
- In some quarters this is linked to an assumption that CRM will reduce the need for more traditional segmentation
- In a special issue on CRM in the Journal of Marketing, the Editors expressed surprise at finding ‘traditional’ segmentation working alongside CRM (Boulding et al., 2005).  Some of these used only a few variables 

*But should they really have been surprised?*


## Conclusion

**We have looked at some tools for analysing the current situation and identifying issues to address in the plan:**

- **PESTLE** takes a wider view of the environment within which the market map sits
- **Porter’s Five Forces analysis** looks at what will shape competition in the future
- **The Product Lifecycle** takes a long view of whether a product category is new, growing, mature or declining
- **The Boston matrix** is one way of trying to summarise the portfolio as a basis for resource allocation. We will cover further developments in portfolio analysis in a future session. Next, though, we will look at how to segment the market.

**We have covered some of the things a marketing audit needs to cover:**

- A **financial summary** of the present situation. This should outline market size and growth, market share, revenue, and maybe profits by segment.

- A **market map**. This explains how the market works (channels, influencers etc)

- A **market segmentation**. This takes a particular junction on the market map (e.g. end consumers) and divides the members into groups with similar needs.

There are many ways to segment markets. For marketing planning, a needs-based segmentation is often best.

# Part 3: Summarising the portfolio: MAF, CSF & DPM

Critical success factors, market attractiveness factors and the Directional Policy Matrix

**Agenda: techniques for summarising the portfolio of product-markets**

- Market Attractiveness Factors (MAFs)
- Critical Success Factors (CSFs)
- The Directional Policy Matrix

The situation review as a basis for **resource allocation**

- Scarce means but “unlimited ends”
	- People
	- R&D
	- Customer support and time
	- Money
- Rationing, setting priorities
- How much can the organisation handle?

**The STPA process** (Segmentation Marketing Position Approaching) 

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_MKT/STP process.png" style="zoom:38%;" />

**What are your main target markets?** 

> - A target market is a a group of people or organisations 
>
> - for which an organisation designs, implements and maintains 
>
> - a marketing mix intended to meet the needs of that group. 
>
> -- (Summers et al., 2005)

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_MKT/Market Targeting.png" style="zoom:48%;" />

**Which segment is the best segment to target?**

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_MKT/Target segment.png" style="zoom:28%;" />

## 1. MAF (Market Attractive Factors)

**Figuring out segment attractiveness**

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_MKT/Figuring out segment attractiveness.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

**Product-market table**

1. Select a business unit, or part of the business, for which you wish to develop a plan. Business unit: ___________________

2. Along the top of the table below, list the principal products, product groups or services sold by the business unit, ignoring unimportant ones.

	<img src="/assets/img/Pic_MKT/Product-market table.png" style="zoom:33%;" />

3. Down the left of the table, list the principal markets, or market segments, you sell into, ignoring unimportant ones

4. Now choose between 4 and 15 product-markets (cells) to concentrate on in the plan, by putting an ‘x’ in the cell.

**Market attractiveness – multiple segments**

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_MKT/MAF.png" style="zoom:48%;" />

**Some typical MAFs**

- Size of segment 
- Segment growth
- Segment profitability
	- For industry, not you!
	- You can use 5 forces as drivers of profitability
- Risk, eg adverse legislation
- Fit with mission

**Process for evaluating market attractiveness**

1. At the corporate level, decide what the market attractiveness factors (MAFs) are (usually 3 to 5 factors)
2. Give each MAF an importance weight to the company (total weights should sum to 100%)
3. For each MAF, define the scoring criteria (what constitutes low attractiveness, medium attractiveness, and high attractiveness)
4. Using the scoring criteria, score each market on a scale of 0 to 10 against each factor (where 0 is extremely low and 10 is extremely high attractiveness)
5. Multiply the importance weights by the attractiveness scores to produce a weighted attractiveness score
6. Evaluate the total weighted scores – do they seem to make sense, intuitively?

**Hints for MAF analysis**

- Keep it simple – ideally 6 factors or less
- Keep factors independent of each other
- Typically size, growth and profitability represented
- Clear the factors and weights with the board at an early stage
- Use the results to decide which business areas to concentrate on

## 2. CSF (Critical Success Factors)

*Assessing business strengths*

**Objectives:** 

- To understand how to compare the competitive position of different product-markets using Critical Success Factors 
- To understand how to construct a Directional Policy Matrix as a basis for resource allocation

**The Cranfield SWOT: SWOT analysis using critical success factors** 

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_MKT/SWOT analysis using critical success factors.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

***Refined Value-in-use, Motivators and hygiene factors With CSF***

**CSF analysis**

1. Identify the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) that influence the customers’ decision. There are usually not more than 6 really important factors. If you have done a value-in-use analysis, you can usually just use value-in-use dimensions (unless they are hygiene factors).
2. Assign an importance weighting to each CSF so that the weightings for each segment totals 100%
3. Identify the key competitors for each segment and score performance of your company and each key competitor on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 = very poor and 10 = excellent. Limit to a few competitors (between 1 and 3).
4. Multiply the weights by the scores and add up the weighted score for each competitor.
5. Assess your relative strength by subtracting the best competitor’s score from your score.
6. Identify the key issues from the analysis.
7. Note you can change your relative business strength by focusing on improving your strength on the criteria that matter most to customers.

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_MKT/CSF.png" style="zoom:48%;" />

**Hints on CSF analysis**

1. Critical success factors are in the eye of the customer: perception is reality!
2. External validation best
	- Market research ideal
	- B2B: you can fill in with a customer
	- Consider involving channel partners
	- If necessary, use internal cross-functional team of people who are close to the customers in that segment (eg sales, service, market research, R&D…)
3. Validate the results against current financials
4. Different segments are likely to have different CSFs 
	- ..or at most, the same CSFs but with different weightings
	- If they’re identical, either you need to do your market research, or your segmentation is wrong!

## 3. DPM (Directional Policy Matrix)

**About the DPM** 

- Vertical axis = attractiveness of market segments, constructed from the Market Attractiveness Factors for the business. These should be generic, and allow comparison of existing and potential business. 
- Horizontal axis = business strengths against the Critical Success Factors for each segment, relative to the competition. 
- Relative business strengths should be measured against best competitor(not average) and from the point of view of the customer. 
- Size of circles should be proportional to amount of business (current revenue); you can add a pie slice indicating profit/contribution. 
- Information-rich matrix allows the application of useful policy guidelines for marketing strategies

**Directional Policy Matrix**

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_MKT/Directional Policy Matrix.png" style="zoom:38%;" />

## Summary

- Market attractiveness analysis helps to target resources on the most attractive product-markets
- SWOT analysis can be unfocused. The extended SWOT helps to focus on the impact on the customer
- Critical Success Factors are even better as they start with customer needs and work backwards to our strengths and weaknesses in meeting those needs

# Part 4: Market Strategy Formulation - Assumptions, Marketing Objectives and Strategies

**Objectives**

By the end of this session you will:

- Appreciate the need to document assumptions which can affect the outcome but cannot itself be directly managed.
- Appreciate the role of the Ansoff matrix, gap analysis and the DPM in setting marketing objectives
- Appreciate the role of CSFs and the 7Ps in defining marketing strategies
- Appreciate how alternate mixes might need to be considered.

## 1. Assumption

The purpose of assumptions is to identify those factors that will be critical to the success or failure of the marketing strategy, but which are outside your direct control

**About Assumption**

- They are few in number 
- They cannot be altered directly by the company, but will be critical to the achievement of the plan 
- Assumptions could be about, for example: 
	- Raw materials costs 
	- Exchange rates 
	- Economic factors 
	- Political factors

*Look at Porter 5-forces analysis & PESTLE analysis to check for important assumptions you are making*

**Key assumptions - example from a bank**

| Key Assumption                                               | Implications                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Foreign banks will not be allowed to operate locally in the next 5 years | We have to concentrate on meeting fierce competition from our existing rivals. |
| Offshore banks will open for business                        | They will syphon off some of our best and most experienced staff. |
| The private sector will continue to expand and offer superior remuneration and fringe benefits | They will attract high quality staff in the market and at least a few of our experienced managers / qualified / specialised staff / University graduates. |
| The commercial banks will continue to be state controlled    | Risk of demotivation of staff through inadequate remuneration/incentives. Decisions can be affected by political considerations. |

## 2. Setting Marketing Objectives - Ansoff matrix, gap analysis & DPM

### 2.1 Marketing objectives and marketing strategies

The purpose of setting marketing objectives and marketing strategies is to target what share of the market we must capture to satisfy our mission and how we will bring together our marketing mix to achieve the target for each product-market.

**REMINDER:** *Marketing objectives are meant in a very specific sense to mean which products and services we are going to market to which customer groups, with what financial results*

**Marketing Objectives, Strategies and Tactics**

**Strategies suggested by portfolio matrix analysis**

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_MKT/Strategies suggested by portfolio matrix analysis.png" style="zoom:48%;" />

### 2.2 Use the DPM to help determine competitive strategies

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_MKT/Use the DPM to help determine competitive strategies.png" style="zoom:48%;" />

**Strategy documentation example (with beginnings of tactics)**

Earthmoving tyres, > 50 tons market segment:

The purpose of these strategies is to increase market share from 15 to 20% over the planning period, through:

1. Improved selection of the right tyre for the job, through better site surveys make in active consultation with manufacturer, and by reference to the optimal tyre choice arrived at on other similar mines.

2. Improve the quality and durability of tyres through better two-way communication with manufacturer’s technical personnel

3. Improve the frequency and quality of technical backup to mines through better-trained representatives and user feedback (clear reports and requests for corrective action).

4. Pressure manufacturer for improved continuity of supply through more production facilities and product committed to us.

5. Target manufacturer for a price improvement strategy to enhance price competitiveness and reduced cost per hour

6. Offer performance warranties comparable with local industry  standards.

Note: any user in which a clear product advantage cannot be established will not be targeted until the right product is available. We are effectively competing in nearly all mines in this segment at present.

### 2.3 The marketing gap

## 3. Defining Marketing Strategies - 7Ps & CSFs

### 3.1 7Ps

**The first marketing mix – 4Ps**

- Product 
	- Product or service 
	- Definition issues: core versus extended 
- Price 
	- Absolute and relative prices 
	- Pricing strategies (skimming, penetration, follow, lead) 
	- Versioning 
- Promotion 
	- Communications (ad, PR, mail, exhibition) 
	- Special offers 
- Place 
	- Distribution 
	- Channels and their integration

### Summary

- Recording assumptions is a sensible planning activity so that others picking up the plan can see on what your plan was based, and can help with contingency/scenario planning
- Marketing objectives and strategies should be specific to the product-market and should help deliver the corporate objectives. They should take into account the position of the product-market on the DPM
- Ansoff’s matrix and gap analysis are useful tools for making sure that corporate objectives are met with an acknowledgement of risk
