# Introduction

**Target**

- Differentiate different ways of conceptualising people in organisations. 
- Assess and evaluate the importance of relationships at work, group dynamics, effective teams and leadership in achieving effectiveness. 
- Critically engage with relevant models, theories and ideas in order to enhance personal capability linked to their personal and professional development agenda.

## Introduction

### Gibb’s Reflective Cycle

<img src="D:\Documents\Cranfield Study\Courses\Organisational Behaviour - Application\Pic_OBA\Gibbs Reflective Cycle.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

### Reflective writing 

**is:**

- your response to experiences, opinions, events or new information 
- your response to thoughts and feelings 
- a way of thinking to explore your learning 
- an opportunity to gain self-knowledge 
- a way to achieve clarity and better understanding of what you are learning 

**is NOT:** 

- just conveying information, instruction or argument 
- pure description, though there may be descriptive elements 
- straightforward decision or judgement (e.g. about whether something is right or wrong, good or bad) 
- simple problem-solving 
- a summary of course notes

**OB Field Map**

### Ladder of Inference

<img src="D:\Documents\Cranfield Study\Courses\Organisational Behaviour - Application\Pic_OBA\Ladder of Inference.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

**Game (Hand and back)**

- At what distance apart are two points felt as one? 
- Is there a difference between you?

### Ways of Conceptualising Organizations - Morgan (1997)

- Machines 
- Organisms 
- Brains 
- Cultures 
- Political Systems 
- Psychic Prisons 
- Flux and Transformation 
- Instruments of Domination

## Learning - CSI (Cognitive Style Index)

### Functions:

- Recruitment 
- Career guidance 
- Designing tasks 
- Managing conflict 
- Mentoring 
- Training 
- Improving self awareness 
- Understanding others

### Result Explanation

<img src="D:\Documents\Cranfield Study\Courses\Organisational Behaviour - Application\Pic_OBA\CSI.png" style="zoom:38%;" />

**Intuitive** 

- Can make ‘leaps’ 
- Can just ‘know’ something 
- Can just know something about someone 
- Connections happen out of awareness 
- Can see links and patterns in data 
- Follow ‘gut feeling’ 
- The ‘big picture’ is enough 
- Analysis of all parts is sometimes tedious

**Quasi - Intuitive** 

- Can make ‘leaps’ 
- Can just ‘know’ something 
- Can see links and patterns in data 
- Don’t know why they know 
- Sometimes follow ‘gut feeling’ 
- The ‘big picture’ is usually enough 
- Sometimes need more reflection to be sure 
- Sometimes need to reflect rather than act

**Adaptive** 

- Draw on both 
- Comfortable using both sides 
- Balanced 
- Can see merit in various ways of working 
- Can use analysis and intuition sequentially 
- Can act as a bridge between the other sides

**Quasi - Analyst** 

- Systematic and planful 
- Logic is valued, but ‘gut feel’ or intuition also needs to be paid attention to 
- Analysis involves breaking down a problem into its parts, only then can synthesis occur 
- Detailed and relevant information is usually the basis of learning and deciding 
- If no logical solution is clear then intuition may be applied, or it can be used to check answers 
- After stopping working on a problem may get sudden insights about solutions

**Analyst** 

- Systematic and planful 
- Logic is highly valued 
- Analysis involves breaking down a problem, into its parts, only then can synthesis occur 
- Detailed and relevant information is the basis of learning and deciding 
- Parts of a solution may or may not be linked 
- Established methods can benefit 

# I. Individuals in the organisation (Personality - MBTI)

**Advantages of MBTI**

### 1. The Concept of Preferences

| Preferred                                                    | Non_Preferred                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Easy <br/>Quick <br/>Didn’t have to think <br/>Automatic <br/>Natural | Awkward <br/>Slow <br/>Had to concentrate <br/>Messy <br/>Looks child-like <br/>Not ‘me’, but gets easier with practice |

MBTI looks at the ways in which we orientate ourselves to the world; to people, places and things

### 2. MBTI 4 dimensions

<img src="D:\Documents\Cranfield Study\Courses\Organisational Behaviour - Application\Pic_OBA\MBTI 4 dimensions.png" style="zoom:38%;" />

### 3. Key Points about Type

- Type does **not** explain everything 
- “Best Fit Type” 
	- Self – assessed type (from **discussion**) 
	- Reported type (from **questionnaire**) 
	- From this **YOU** decide what is your BEST FIT type 
- Our type strengths, when **overplayed**, reduce our effectiveness

### 4. How I want other to communicate with me (Type group and preference)

| Type | Preference                                                   |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ST   | Be organised and structured <br/>Be practical and realistic <br/>Work logically and systematically through the analysis <br/>Offer proof, good data and evidence |
| NT   | Be clear and explicit, don’t just imply <br/>Show me how individuals will benefit <br/>Demonstrates immediate and practical results soon <br/>Show me and others respect <br/>Be pleasant |
| SF   | Show how it fits into the bigger picture <br/>Ensure the theoretical base is sound <br/>Provide new information <br/>Appeal to my intellect and imagination |
| NF   | Be credible <br/>Engage with my personal values <br/>Paint pictures and draw analogies that have meaning <br/>Be passionate and engage my imagination; link to the desired future <br/>Show me how it will contribute to the “greater good” |

### 5. Questions you can use

**Questions about Personality**

- How would it be if everyone was like you? 
- What are the preferences of your learning team members – look around the Zoom classroom? 
- What are the advantages of having the other type on your team?

**Questions about Teamwork**

- How will this knowledge and self-awareness affect the way you work together in your learning teams? 
- Go through each preference: 
	- If you have someone with an E preference in your group, what do they need from their team members? 
	- If you have someone with I preference in your group, what do they need from their team members? 
- Do the same for S/N, T/F, and J/P

# II. Groups and teams in the organisation (Team)

## 1. Team Role

**Practice**

- List all the teams that you have belonged to
- What was your role in each

### 1.1 Understanding of Team Role

**Working in teams. What was your experience?** 

- Share Explicit Goals, Often
- All members negotiate and ‘buy into’ specific and explicit ground rules
- Have respect (and sometimes liking) for other team members
- Acknowledge diversity / difference; use micro-affirmations/are inclusive
- Give specific, early feedback; continue giving feedback all the time
- Address Team Issues Explicitly; have a developmental focus

**8 Team Roles**

|          | Role                  | Performance                          |
| -------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Action   | Shaper                | Challenges the team to improve.      |
|          | Implementer           | Puts ideas into action.              |
|          | Completer Finisher    | Ensures thorough, timely completion. |
| People   | Coordinator           | Acts as a chairperson.               |
|          | Teamworker            | Encourages cooperation.              |
|          | Resource Investigator | Explores outside opportunities.      |
| Thinking | Plant                 | Presents new ideas and approaches.   |
|          | Monitor-Evaluator     | Analyses the options.                |

**Team role in Group**

<img src="D:\Documents\Cranfield Study\Courses\Organisational Behaviour - Application\Pic_OBA\Team roles chart.png" style="zoom:38%;" />

### 1.2 Team Role Management

**Be Aware Of and Manage Your Allowable Weakness** 

- Ensure allowable weakness does not become disallowable 
	- Plant lose attention in the meeting because they are thinking of ideas -> OK! 
	- Plant does not want to let go of their idea -> NOT OK! 
	- Plant forgets to come to a meeting because they are thinking of something else -> NOT OK!

**Levels of Weakness**

<img src="D:\Documents\Cranfield Study\Courses\Organisational Behaviour - Application\Pic_OBA\Levels of weakness.png" alt="image-20210228152708756" style="zoom: 33%;" />

| **Norming**    | Cohesion             | Enforce standards, adopt roles, agree tasks, agree structures |
| **Performing** | Action (in Role)     | Structures support tasks, Interpersonal relations support task, flexibility |
| **Adjourning** | Disengaging          | Ending of the task, ending of the team, looking back, learning |

<img src="D:\Documents\Cranfield Study\Courses\Organisational Behaviour - Application\Pic_OBA\I keep six honest serving men.png" style="zoom:38%;" />

DISCOVERY: WHAT, WHY, HOW

ACTION PLANNING: WHO, WHEN, WHERE

**WHAT?** 

- Identifies issues 
	- What’s the problem?

| --------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Opening         | Other party  | Open            |
| Identifying     | “            | Open            |

Using the behavioural analysis categories, each team member identify a personal learning point and practice in the coming week.

# III. Organizational Processes (Culture & Change)

**SESSION AIMS** 

- Culture as a way of understanding 
- Shared meanings; Markers and Symbols 
- Recognising culture 
- Culture of your team / Cranfield 
- Implications PESTELE 
- Applications

## 1. Understanding Organisational Culture

### 1.1 An old but helpful definition

1) A pattern of basic assumptions, 
2) invented, discovered, or developed by a given group, 
3) as it learns to cope with its problems of external adaptation and internal integration, 
4) that has worked well enough to be considered valid and , therefore 
5) is to be taught to new members as the 6) correct way to perceive, think, and feel in relation to those problems.

<img src="D:\Documents\Cranfield Study\Courses\Organisational Behaviour - Application\Pic_OBA\Culture onion.png" style="zoom:33%;" />

### 1.2 Place identification

Place-identity is defined as those dimensions of self that define the individual's personal identity in relation to the physical environment by means of a complex pattern of conscious and unconscious ideas, feelings, values, goals, preferences, skills, and behavioural tendencies relevant to a specific environment.

# IV. Organisational Management (Politics, Inclusive Leadership)

## 1. Organisational Politics

**Outline**

- History & Context
- Perceptions of Politics
- Power & Influence
- Some Research findings
- Politics as Skills
- Some gratuitous advice

### 1.1 Politics

- Not a dirty word
- We all do it
- Scarce resources
- Who gets control of them
- **POWER**

**Sources of power**

- Formal Authority
- Control of scarce resources
- Use of organizational structure, rules and regulations
- Control of decision processes
- Control of information 
- Control of Boundaries
- Control of technology
- Ability to cope with uncertainty
- Interpersonal alliances
- Networks
- Symbolism, managing meaning
- Gender
- Stage of action
- Personal Power

*Which of these sources of power do you use?*
*How do you use them?*
*What else could you do?*

**Dimensions: Organizational Politics**

- Social Astuteness 
- Interpersonal Influence 
- Networking Ability 
- Apparent Sincerity

### 1.2 Political Skill

‘‘the ability to effectively understand others at work, and to use such knowledge to influence others to act in ways that enhance one’s personal and/or organizational objectives’’

**Political skill -- Job satisfaction**

<img src="D:\Documents\Cranfield Study\Courses\Organisational Behaviour - Application\Pic_OBA\Job satisfaction.png" style="zoom:25%;" />

**Political skill -- Job performance**

<img src="D:\Documents\Cranfield Study\Courses\Organisational Behaviour - Application\Pic_OBA\Job performance.png" style="zoom: 25%;" />

<img src="D:\Documents\Cranfield Study\Courses\Organisational Behaviour - Application\Pic_OBA\EI.png" style="zoom:38%;" />

“Political skills are essential career competencies that become more important as one ascends the corporate ladder.”

### 1.3 A model of Political Behaviour

![](D:\Documents\Cranfield Study\Courses\Organisational Behaviour - Application\Pic_OBA\4 animals.png)

**Clever**

- "I’ll sort it – they owe me a few favours" (now so do you)
- "I think it would be wrong for me to take this one, it’s not really my thing – but you could do it very very well." (it will fail, so will you)
- "I agree, everybody believes that, it just needs someone to say it" (untrue & dangerous)
- "Yours was a brave decision." (i.e. terrible)

**Inept**

- "They’ll be easy to fool." (sent in an email)
- "She’s very good friends with the Chairman if you know what I mean."
- "Lets make sure they don’t know about our new project and we’ll spring it on them. Then they’ll just have to approve the funds"

**Innocent**

- "That meeting was a waste of time, the first ten minutes they chatted about their kids"
- "I wish I knew what was going on."
- "This is a project that, by rights, we should be leading, and I’ll let them know, it’s obvious."
- "How did that promotion happen so fast?"
- "HR should have a system for knowing about our skills and career aspirations"
- "Its unfair"

**Wise**

- "Can we deal with this issue quickly or do we need to go wider?"
- "I wonder what’s behind this?"
- "Let me check I’ve understood that."
- "Ok so we’ve agreed to do that differently, is there anything else that we need to address?"
- "So the link to the overall business plan is?"

### 1.4 How to fail

- Pretend that organizational politics don’t really matter
- Assume you’re ‘above’ politics
- Hope that others see your worth; keep you head down (maybe even work hard)
- Stay where you are
- Don’t take risks
- Keep yourself to yourself
- Complain, but don’t do anything about it

**How to increase your chances of succeeding**

1. Understand workplace politics exists
2. Gain experience & stretch yourself; demonstrate skill development 
3. Perform and deliver, be useful
4. Be reasonably clever / expert
5. Be lucky 
6. Be nice &/or have friends
7. Be noticed, be visible, be known 
8. Gain support and widely network; know what’s going on – be there
9. Get a mentor : know way around
10. Get a champion / gang: advance

What are the downsides of thinking / acting in a political way?

## 2. Inclusive Leadership

**Session objectives**

- To explore the psychological processes underpinning inclusive leadership.
- To review some of the inclusion and diversity initiatives undertaken by major corporations.
- Specific focus on race inclusion in your own organizations
- To consider the implementation of inclusive leadership and your role in this.

### 2.1 Leadership

**The inevitability of leaders and leadership**

- “Whenever there is social activity, a social structure develops and one (perhaps the) defining characteristic of that structure is the emergence of a leader” (Judge et al, 2009)
- “The ability to build and maintain a group that performs well relative to its competition”(Hogan & Kaiser, 2005:172)
- A process which “involves the use of non-coercive influence to shape a group’s or organization’s goals, motivate behaviour towards the achievement of those goals and help define group or organization culture” (Inyang, 2004:1221)

**Leadership as interaction**

<img src="D:\Documents\Cranfield Study\Courses\Organisational Behaviour - Application\Pic_OBA\Leadership as interaction.png" style="zoom:38%;" />

### 2.2 How behaviour is influenced by our perceptions

> Perception: A process by which individuals organize and interpret their sensory impressions in order to give meaning to their environment

**Elements in the process of perception**

<img src="D:\Documents\Cranfield Study\Courses\Organisational Behaviour - Application\Pic_OBA\Elements in the process of perception.png" style="zoom:38%;" />

**People perception**

- Halo effect – a positive judgement based on a single striking characteristic, such as an aspect of dress, speech, posture, or nationality.
- Horn effect – a negative judgement . . . etc

<img src="D:\Documents\Cranfield Study\Courses\Organisational Behaviour - Application\Pic_OBA\Halo and Horn effects.png" style="zoom:38%;" />

- Stereotype – a category or personality type to which we consign people on the basis of their membership of some known group.

**How do stereotypes affect our behaviour?**
Stereotypes are generalizations or assumptions that people make about the characteristics of all members of a group, based on an image about what people in that group are like.

- **Stereotypes** 
a problem when they are inaccurate, especially when those inaccuracies are negative and hostile. 
- **Prejudice** 
belief that a stereotype is true for all of that group. 
- **Discrimination** 
acting on your prejudices and withdrawing favours/imposing costs from stereotyped group members.

*Further interest - Ted talk about stereotyping*

> - “The single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story.” (Chimamanda NgoziAdichie)
> - http://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story.html
>

**Unconscious bias**

- Unconscious or implicit biases are based on the association between one object and another –we all have them
- Unconscious Bias training
- Bias is most likely to occur when you are:
	- Under pressure
	- Trying to reach closure
	- Drawing overall impressions

> **Protected characteristics under the UK Equality Act 2010**
>
> *There are nine protected characteristics:* age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, sexual orientation

### 2.3 The paradox of inclusion

***Organizational approaches to inclusion and diversity - Presentation***

> *In pairs of learning teams, each team give their three minute presentation:*
>
> - *Which dimensions of diversity are mentioned and/or emphasized on this company website?*
> - *What does this organisation actually do with regard to diversity and inclusion? (e.g. events, staff groups, monitoring and reporting etc.)*
> - *How does diversity affect the way the company does business, for example, in relation to suppliers?*
> - *Does your allocated organization specifically refer to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals? If so, which SDGs?*
>
> *Then discuss what you found about the approach to inclusion and diversity. In particular be ready to share with the whole group:*
> - *A positive*
> - *A surprise*
> - *Something that could be done better*
> 
> **One company’s approach: BAE Systems**
> 
> <img src="D:\Documents\Cranfield Study\Courses\Organisational Behaviour - Application\Pic_OBA\One companys approach - BAE Systems.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

**What is meant by inclusion?** 

- The removal of obstacles to the full participation and contribution of employees in organizations (Roberson, 2006)
- When individuals feel a sense of belonging, and inclusive behaviours such as eliciting and valuing contributions from all employees are part of the daily life in the organization (Lirio et al, 2008) 
- The extent to which employees believe their organizations engage in efforts to involve all employees in the mission and operation of the organization with respect to their individual talents (Avery et al, 2010)

<img src="D:\Documents\Cranfield Study\Courses\Organisational Behaviour - Application\Pic_OBA\What is meant by inclusion.png" style="zoom:38%;" />

<img src="D:\Documents\Cranfield Study\Courses\Organisational Behaviour - Application\Pic_OBA\What is meant by inclusion 1.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

**What is Inclusive Leadership?**

Inclusive leadership is the extent to which individuals in positions of organizational privilege and power enable others’ access to information, resources, and participation in decision-making by being open and available to less powerful others

**Inclusive Leadership Competencies**

<img src="D:\Documents\Cranfield Study\Courses\Organisational Behaviour - Application\Pic_OBA\Inclusive Leadership Competencies.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

**Varies from traditional views of leadership**

Psychological safety

- We associate leadership competence with attributes like charisma, self-promotion, speaking up first, and speaking longest
- These characteristics may not actually be the “stuff” that makes leaders effective in creating inclusive environments
- Qualities like “standing back,” humility, and self-sacrifice can go a long way in making leaders more inclusive and effective

*What is the current concern for inclusive leadership in organizations?*

> Race and Ethnicity highlighted by COVID19 and BLM
>
> The potential benefit to the UK economy from full representation of BME individuals across the labour market, through improved participation and progression, is estimated to be £24 billion a year, which represents 1.3% of GDP
>

***What the data tells us***

The need to accelerate progression

ONLY ONE IN TEN PEOPLE IN THE WORKPLACE ARE BAME compared to one in eight of the working age population.

<img src="D:\Documents\Cranfield Study\Courses\Organisational Behaviour - Application\Pic_OBA\The need to accelerate progression.png" style="zoom:30%;" />

### 2.4 How should organization’s address race inclusion?

Senior leaders are having this conversation

1. What is the business and social case?
2. What (specific) steps should an organization take to improve race inclusion?
3. What (specific) steps can you take to improve race inclusion in any organization where you work?

**Change the Race Ratio**
Four commitments to change (based on Parker review findings)

- Increase racial and ethnic diversity among Board members
- Increase racial and ethnic diversity in senior leadership
- Be transparent on targets and actions
- Create an inclusive culture in which talent from all diversities can thrive

**Inclusive leadership**

Inclusive leaders get the best out of all their people, helping their organizations to succeed in today’s complex, diverse national and global environment. 

Through their skills in adaptability, building relationships and developing talent, inclusive leaders are able to increase performance and innovation. (Opportunity Now, 2014)

**Five-point framework for inclusive leadership**

<img src="D:\Documents\Cranfield Study\Courses\Organisational Behaviour - Application\Pic_OBA\Five-point framework for inclusive leadership.png" style="zoom:38%;" />

1. **Vision**
Set out 
- why inclusive leadership matters to your business
- what inclusive leadership will bring that is different
- how the impact of inclusive behaviours will be evaluated and rewarded

2. **Lead**
Build a group of sponsors 
- Influencing change in leadership is beyond the scope of any one individual
- It requires many different areas of expertise

3. **Develop**
Building inclusive competencies into the core of management and leadership
- Adaptability
- Developing diverse talent
- Building inclusive relationships

4. **Embed**
Make inclusive leadership sustainable; embed the competencies into criteria for recruiting, promoting and assessing the performance of leaders
And making the necessary culture change

5. **Evaluate**
Track the impact of inclusive leadership and ensure accountability at the senior level to ensure objectives are being met

**How will you practice being an inclusive leader everyday?**

- Reflect on how different you think your experience and success might be if you had a different ‘race’, gender, sexual orientation or degree of physical ability? What can you do to nudge culture change in a small way so these differential experiences are reduced?
- Role model a culture of listening and respect across the organisation. 
- Skilfully challenge i.e. ‘call out’ instances of non-inclusive behaviour you observe. 
- Don’t leave it to visibly different ‘Others’ to champion inclusion. 
- When considering a new employer, read the organization’s D&I strategy and identify three actions you personally, as a manager or colleague, might consider doing to improve key trends.

### 3.1 What causes Change?

**Change rates**

**Kotter’s 8 Stages of Change Model**

<img src="D:\Documents\Cranfield Study\Courses\Organisational Behaviour - Application\Pic_OBA\Kotters 8 Stages of Change Model.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

**Other Change Models Include:**

- Nudge Theory
- Bridges’ Transition Model
- Kübler-Ross Five Stage Model
- ADKAR
- McKinsey 7S model
- Etc..

**(Un)Success rate of organisational change efforts** 

Most studies show a 60-70% failure rate for organisational change efforts — a statistic that has stayed constant from the 1970’s to the present 

- Only few organisational change efforts are successful 
- Most organisational change efforts are unsuccessful or only marginally successful 
- A few organisational change efforts are utter failures

### 3.2 Why do change programmes fail?

**Kotter – Common Errors**

**Change and Transition are not the same** 

**Change**, whether planned or unplanned, happens. 

- It is an external event, tangible and (sometimes) rational. 
- You can find ways to understand it.

**Transition** is the psychological readjustment required to accept and integrate the change. 

- It is personal, emotional, internal and takes a lot longer. 
- Transitions follows seven predictable stages.

**The Seven Stages of Transition**

1. Shock -- Numbness
2. Disbelief -- Rejection
3. Resistance -- Emotional Turmoil
4. Acceptance -- Let go of the past
5. Experimentation -- Try out new ways
6. Understanding -- Search for meaning
7. Integration -- Live the new reality

**In your career, you will have faced many organisational changes...**

As an employee how do you manage organisational change: 

Champion? Actively participate?  Play ball? Wait and see?  Duck for cover?  Resist (overtly or surreptitiously)? Opt out?

### 3.3 Change Leadership

**Kotter – Change Management v Leadership**

**Leadership theories through the ages...** 

Great Man Theory /Trait Theory - mid-1800’s to 1940’s

Behavioural Theories/Leadership “Style” - 1940’s – 1960’s

Contingency & Situational Theories - 1960’s – 1980’s

Transactional & Transformational leadership - 1980’s – 1990’s and beyond

**Transformational leaders**

- Idealised Influence (Charisma) 
Provides vision and sense of mission, instils pride, gains respect and trust
- Inspirational Motivation
Communicates high expectations, uses symbols to focus efforts, expresses important purposes in simple ways
- Intellectual stimulation 
Promotes intelligence, rationality, and careful problem solving
- Individualised consideration 
Gives personal attention, treats each employee individually, coaches, advises

<img src="D:\Documents\Cranfield Study\Courses\Organisational Behaviour - Application\Pic_OBA\Transformational leaders.png" style="zoom:38%;" />

**The dark side of leadership**

Narcissism: “excessive interest in or admiration of oneself and one's physical appearance.”
- A grandiose preoccupation with one’s own self-importance 
- The belief that one is special and more important than others 
- Fantasies of unlimited success
- Arrogance
- Power seeking
- Entitlement
- Hypersensitivity to criticism
- Lack of empathy

Hubris: “Excessive self-confidence and self-belief” leads to: 
- Taking poorly calculated risks 
- Over-paying for acquisitions 
- Blind spots

**The challenge for managers is:**

- Flexing their leadership style according to individual subordinate’s needs
	- Rather than their allowing their own personal preferences dictate how to lead (e.g. someone who is comfortable supporting may need to be directive)
- Maintaining a style that suits individuals even when there is a dominant organisational cultural style
- Not appearing either rigid or —people are treated fairly not identically 
- Changing their approach to leading individuals when circumstances change 
	- e.g. moving back from delegating to coaching when leading organisational change: people need to learn new skills, processes or methods and require support and coaching where they may have been comfortable with delegation previously

**Summary**

What three things have you learnt from this session?

- Change is a constant
Speed is increasing due to digitisation and globalisation 
- Change is hard
Change programmes most often fail
- Change leadership isn’t about you
It’s about those you are leading through the transformation
