# Sessions 5-6 What Capabilities Do We Have -- The Resource-Based View

**Target**

- Explain the **importance of resources, capabilities, and activities** in organizational strategy.
- Explain how an organization can identify and compete through the **deployment** of **distinctive resources**.
- Evaluate the **potential** of an organization to **manage** its resource base over time through **dynamic** capabilities.

## Framework of Resource-based View (RBV) theorizing
At the centre of RBV theorizing is a search for resources that give the organization a possible competitive edge.

This crucial conceptual framework is known as the VRIO or VRIN

**VRIO**

- Value
	- Can be used to create outputs of value to customers that they are willing to pay for (or fund, in the case of not for profit)
- Rare
	- In limited supply
	- Not available to all organizations
- Imperfectly imitable (难模仿)
	- It is not possible to copy or create the resource, or obtain the same value from other means
- Organization
	- Available in a format in which it can actually be used, if required, by the organization in its specific context

**VRIN**

- Valuable
	- Increases PUV
	- Lowers Costs
- Rare
- Inimitable
- Non-substitutable

***Resource bundles and complementarities***

> The RBV highlights that VRIO/VRIN resources are rarely, if ever, deployed on their own. Instead, resources tend to be configured in ‘bundles’ during use (Miller and Shamsie 1996). On its own a resource might enable no, or a very limited range of, capabilities. In **combination** with other resources, the potential for taking action can be significantly enhanced.

## Categories of Strategic Asset
- **Tangible Assets:** location, equipment, patents, information
- **System Assets:** operating, quality, induction, training, proposal writing
- **Structural Assets:** grouping, coordination processes, accountability
- **Knowledge Assets:** technical know-how, tacit routines, entrepreneurial insight, knowledge architecture
- **Relational Assets:** trust, reputation, brand, contracts, switching costs, social capital
- **Cultural Assets:** creativity, cooperation, responsiveness, professionalism, learning

## Distinctive and threshold capabilities
**Distinctive capabilities**

- Refer to the potential to take value-creating actions that are **not available to all competitors**.

- For a capability to be considered distinctive, it doesn’t have to be unique, just ‘**not common**’ or shared amongst competitors.

**Threshold capabilities**

- The capabilities that an organization is **required to maintain to a minimum performance** level.
- create the **conditions** in which distinctive capabilities can be **exploited**.

## Competencies

- ***Distinctive competences*** draw on **distinctive resources** to achieve outcomes that are prized by the customer (Ackermann and Eden 2011).
- ***Core competences*** describe competences that **recur** throughout an organization, underpinning value creation and strategy **across all aspects of operations** (Prahalad and Hamel (1990).
- ***Core rigidities*** describes resources which were **once valuable**, and are still considered so in strategy work, but which are in actuality a **hindrance** to organizational performance.

## Dynamic capability
- Definition: the **organizational capacity** to **create, extend, or modify** the **resource base** (Helfat et al. 2007:4). 
- Can be used to **adjust** the resource base in **reaction** to environmental **changes**, or to modify the resource base to **build** new or modified **capabilities for anticipated future needs** (Schoemaker et al. 2018).
- Dynamic capabilities are the **subset** of organizational capabilities associated with **managing or manipulating** the resource base.

## Sources of Inimitability(不可模仿性)
- Causal Ambiguity 原因不明确
- Path Dependency
- Asset Configuration 资产配置

| **Asset Candidate** | PUV (5) | Costs (5) | Rare (5) | Inimitable (5) | Non-Substitutable (5) | Total (25) | \*Category | **Where can it be leveraged?** |

**Summary**

- Explain the importance of building understanding of resources, capabilities, and activities in organizational strategy.
- Explain how an organization can identify and compete through the deployment of distinctive resources.
- Evaluate the potential of an organization to manage its resource base over time through dynamic capabilities.
- Appraise the configuration of an organization as a set of supporting and value-adding activities.
