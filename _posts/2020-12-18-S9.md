# Session 9-10 Corporate Level Strategy

## Definitions & Terminologies

### Levels of Strategy
- Corporate:
	What is the overall rationale and scope of the corporation – how can the corporate centre add value to the constituent businesses?
- Business:
	How can we compete effectively? 
	How can we deliver sustainable competitive advantage?
- Functional:
	How can the different functional operations contribute to effective implementation of business/corporate strategy?
	
### What is Corporate Strategy?
Corporate-level strategy is concerned with the **overall purpose and scope** of an organisation, which businesses it is in, and how **value will be added** to the different businesses of the organisation

### What is the corporate purpose?
#### The Notion of Corporate Parenting
- Corporations **create value** by 'parenting' the businesses (SBUs) they own
- The best parent companies **create more value** than any of their rivals would if they owned the same businesses: These companies have a **parenting advantage**
- Parenting advantage occurs when the parent's capabilities and resources **fit** well with the needs and opportunities of the businesses
- Therefore corporations should build **portfolios** of businesses **around the parent organisation’s capabilities and resources**

**Conglomerates(联合大企业) Still Valued in Emerging Markets**
*Overcome relative lack of institutional infrastructure:*

- External risk capital harder to access, e.g. developing capital markets 
- Consumers may favour big 'umbrella' brands, due to perceived lack of confidence in regulatory standards
- Political influence: critical mass of lobbying capability to negotiate bureaucratic processes

### How do we add value to our SBUs?

**The Corporate Value Creation Logics ---- Five ways to add value**

Governance-based logics
1. **Financial Control**

2. **Consolidation of support activities**(合并支持活动)

### What is the *desired* portfolio of SBUs? & What is the *current* portfolio of SBUs?

***Evaluating Fit within the Corporate Portfolio: The Corporate Parenting Matrix***

#### Assessing Corporate-SBU Fit
"Fit between a parent and its businesses is a two-edged sword: a good fit can create value; a bad one can destroy it" (Goold, Campbell & Alexander, 1995)
1. How well do the parent’s characteristics fit the businesses’ parenting opportunities? [“benefit”]
	- this indicates the potential for value creation
	- consider the parent’s capabilities (including its primary 'value creation logic') and the parenting opportunities for the business unit 
2. How well do the parent’s characteristics fit with the businesses’ critical success factors? [“feel”]
	- A lack of “feel” indicates potential for value destruction
	- consider the parent’s corporate culture and that required for the business unit’s success.


#### The Corporate Parenting Matrix

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_STG/Evaluating the Fit in the Corporate Portfolio.png" alt="Evaluating the Fit in the Corporate Portfolio" style="zoom:40%;" />

- **Heartland** businesses are ones to which the parent can add value without danger of doing harm. They should be at the **core** of future strategy.
- **Ballast** businesses are ones the parent **understands well but can do little for**. They would probably be just as successful as independent companies and may be worth more to other corporate parents who could add value to them. If they are part of a future corporate strategy, they need to be managed with a light touch and bear as little cost of the corporate bureaucracy as possible.
- **Value trap** businesses are **dangerous**. They appear attractive because there are opportunities for the parent to add value, but the parents’ characteristics **do not fit well** with the SBUs critical success factors. Value trap businesses should only be included in the future strategy if they can be moved into the heartland, and hence if the parent can adjust its characteristics (unlikely!)
- **Alien** businesses are clear **misfits**. They offer little opportunity to add value and they do not fit with the parent’s characteristics. **Divestment** is the best strategy before value in the SBU is destroyed.

#### *Some Implications*
- **Divesting Alien** businesses is important to avoid value destruction within the portfolio.
- Higher value creation comes from **focusing on Heartland** businesses and **fine-tuning** parenting capabilities **to best match** the parenting opportunities of the Heartland businesses. 
- This reinforces the need to refine the corporation’s structure, systems and culture to best facilitate its favoured value creation logic.
- Value trap businesses might suggest that the corporate centre should adjust its characteristics to improve its ‘feel’ for the businesses. But is it realistic for the centre to behave in different ways towards different businesses? Some SBU managers are likely to see this as unfair (two sets of rules) and it dilutes the focus required for optimal parenting of Heartland businesses. 
- Businesses are **dynamic**. The Matrix requires regular review as the critical success factors of the SBUs change with their environments and the parent develops new capabilities.
