Definition of Successful Recovery: moving from low or declining ROI to growing ROI sustained over at least two year period

### **Effective Recovery Strategies: key elements identified by prior research** 

#### 1. Pursuit of *Cost Efficiencies* 
- **Belt-tightening** to stabilise position / improve cash flow
- Frequently includes **review** of firm’s financial structure (e.g. to relieve pressure of short term debt repayments) 
- ***Over-pursuit*** of cost efficiencies can damage customer value proposition and employee morale
- Similarly, dangers in ***focusing sole on*** R&D / training etc
- **Focus** should be on elimination of **high cost** activities that deliver **little customer value**

**Use the PUV to identifying candidates**

#### 2. Asset Retrenchment / Divestment *资产缩减/剥离*
- **Review** of all activities to assess financial contribution
- **Divestment** of low profitability activities
- Impact on **remaining** activities needs to be **evaluated** to avoid loss of strategic capability
- **Realistic assessment** of **likely** sale proceeds required 
- Proceeds can be **reinvested** in strengthening core business
#### 3. Focus on *Core* Activities
- **Focus** on markets, products and customers with **greatest profit potential**
- Consider your **best** known product lines, **most** loyal / least price sensitive customer segments, areas of distinctive **competitive** strength 
- Once defined, develop **a clear competitive strategy** based on understanding of customer needs
- Closer customer relationships, increased focus on marketing, broadening sales channels, optimising service, all associated with success
#### 4. Build for *Future* Growth
- Only once financial stability assured 
- Typically based on controlled growth of core business into new customer segments or geographic territories
- Requires recognition and leverage of **existing** strategic capabilities
- Long term sustainability will require ambidexterity: continued pursuit of efficiency in core business with simultaneous development of capacity for innovation and adaptation.
#### 5. Reinvigoration of Firm *Leadership*
- Build committed and positive management approach
- Often via replacement of CEO / Top Management Team
    - signals crisis and need for change
    - historic mental models may no longer be appropriate
    - Existing leadership may not recognise need to change if it challenges past decisions/investments
- Need to **balance** leadership change with potential internal disruption and loss of market knowledge.
- Overall, successful recovery associated with "**bias for action**"
#### 6. *Culture* Change
- Typically, in concert with leadership change 
- May be necessary to challenge outdated assumptions
- Reinforces adaptation and new market realities 
- Challenging cultural "symbols" can be key to change
#### Summary: Effective Recovery Strategies (key elements identified by prior research) 
- Focus on the **core business** coupled with **retrenchment** from **unprofitable** activities
- **Clear and improved** competitive positioning within the core business, with a **distinctive value** proposition based on an understanding of customer needs
- **Strong cost control**, which focuses on the elimination of high cost activities that deliver little customer value
- A positive and committed **management approach**, often achieved through leadership and accompanying culture change
- Controlled **future** development, with growth pursued only once financial stability restored and then based on recognition and leveraging of the firm’s underlying strategic capabilities
