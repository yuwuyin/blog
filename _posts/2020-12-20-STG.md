# Sessions 1-2 Introduction The Strategy Agenda

## What is Strategic Management? 

### A Simple Definition of Strategy
Strategy is the ***Long Term Direction*** of an organisation

### Good Strategy involves:
- An insightful diagnosis of the situation at hand
- An overall approach (guiding policy) for dealing with the critical issues 
- A set of coherent actions

### Business Strategy: The Five Key Questions

### Corporate Strategy: The Five Key Questions
<img src="/assets/img/Pic_STG/Corporate Strategy - Key Questions.png" alt="Business Strategy - The Five Key Questions" style="zoom:68%;" />

## Levels of Strategy

- Corporate:
	What is the overall rationale and scope of the corporation – how can the corporate centre add value to the constituent businesses?
- Business:
	How can we compete effectively? 
	How can we deliver sustainable competitive advantage?
- Functional:
	How can the different functional operations contribute to effective implementation of business/corporate strategy?

## Course Structure and Assessment
### Core Textbook:
> **Strategy: Theory, Practice, Implementation.** Mackay, B., Arevuo, M., Mackay, D., Meadows, M. (2020). Oxford University Press

### Assessment: 100% Final Examination
- Closed book exam 
- 1.5 hour exam
- Aims to test knowledge of overall module content
- 6 written questions, covering the module’s topic areas
- All questions must be answered & carry equal marks: 16.66×6
- Most questions will ask for examples

## Strategy Content and Process

### A common view of strategy

- a 'top down' deliberate planning process
- triggered by performance targets
- rational and analytical
- logical sequence of steps 
- involves external and internal analysis 
- option generation, selection, implementation
- planning horizon: 5+ years
- plans translated into detailed budgets etc.
- the strategic plan drives the business
- involves staff planning 'experts'
- may involve external consultants
- provides evidence of 'control'
- often required by other stakeholders (e.g. Corporate HQ, Bank)

### Strategy as Deliberate vs Emergent (深思熟虑vs浮现)

![image-20201217141811966](/assets/img/Pic_STG/Strategy as Deliberate vs Emergent.png)

#### Why might intended strategies not get realized?

- Poor communication
- No clear action plan
- No buy-in/ commitment from top management
- No buy-in/ commitment from staff
- Constrained by current corporate culture
- Inappropriate strategy for the situation
- Unpredicted external events

#### an alternative view…….Strategy as Emergent

- an on-going conversation
- involves all those with relevant knowledge
- emergent and unfolding
- broad guidelines not ‘blueprints’
- guidelines help on-going decision making
- flexible

### Strategy Process: Quality and Commitment

**Critical Issues in the Strategy Process (战略中的关键问题)**

- Quality of Strategy
- Commitment to Strategy

# Sessions 3-4 Where to Compete

## A market-based view (MBV) of strategy
- A focus on the **external** context and its importance as a determinant of **organizational strategy** is often referred to as a market-based view (MBV) of strategy.
- It is also known as an '**outside-in**' perspective on strategy and organizational performance.
- The MBV has roots in **industrial economics theory**, which holds that *the position an organization adopts in the minds of its customers*, relative to its competitors, will be a key determinant of its survival and success in the long run.

## The Competitive Environment

	## Porter's 5 Forces
	
	- Michael Porter and industry structure
	- Essence of strategy formulation is coping with the competition….but it goes further than other competitors - also competing with suppliers and customers for negotiating power
	- The state of competition depends on five forces which determine the industry’s profit potential:
		- Weak forces – superior profits
		- Strong forces – poor profits
	- Companies must understand the forces in order to find a position where they can defend against or influence the key competitive forces.

![Five forces governing market structure and dynamics](/assets/img/Pic_STG/Five forces governing market structure and.png)

<center>Five forces governing market structure and dynamics</center>

### Industry Structure – Five Forces
- Determinants of **New Entry Threat**
	- Capital requirements 
	- Economies of scale
	- Absolute cost advantages
		- learning curve effects
	- Product differentiation 
	- Access to distribution channels
	- Legislation
	
- Determinants of **Supplier Power**
	- Supplier concentration
	- Importance of volume to supplier
	- Switching costs
	- Presence of substitute inputs
	- Threat of forward integration
	
- Determinants of **Buyer Power**
	- Bargaining leverage
	- Buyer concentration versus firm concentration
	- Buyer volume
	- Buyer information
	- Buyer switching costs
	- Ability to backward integrate
	- Price sensitivity
	- Fraction of buyer's costs
	- Importance to buyers quality
	- Buyer's own margin position
	
- Determinants of **Substitution Threat**
	- Relative price performance
	- Switching costs
	- Buyer propensity to substitute
	
- **Rivalry** Determinants
	
	- No/balance of competitors
	- Industry growth rate
	- Fixed costs/overcapacity
	- Product differentiation
	- Exit barriers
	- Diversity of competitors
	
	### Limitations of Five Forces analysis
	- Five Forces is too **static** – it’s a **snapshot**. 
	- Five Forces insights are **highly dependent on** where the **market/industry boundaries** are drawn.
	- Five Forces **ignores the effects of non-competitive products and services** that influence profitability - focuses attention on the direct supplier, buyer, and competitor relationships in a specific market.
	- Five Forces analysis doesn’t take into consideration the **potential importance** of regulations and their impact on the markets/industry.

## Defining the industry 
- Is difficult but crucial
- An industry is **a group of firms** producing **products** which are **close substitutes** for each other
- Who **buyers** see as competitors - does this differ on occasions or in different contexts?
- **Geographical** limits to competition - is this a local, national, global industry/market ?
- **Industry value chain**, where does the **power** lie?

## Basic Strategy Options from Industry Analysis
**Defend** - adopt a position within the industry that **defends against (avoids) the strongest forces** (e.g. target buyer groups with lower power)
**Influence** - **pursue strategies** that will in time change the balance of forces driving profitability in your favour (e.g. intra-industry M&A *(Merger and Acquisition)* to build critical mass to gain leverage over suppliers/buyers)
**Exploit** - adopt strategies which take advantage of changes in the nature of the forces (e.g. enter production of improved substitute product)

## Strategic group analysis
- Strategic group analysis **identifies direct competitors** that should be studied as part of micro-level analysis. 
- As reported by Cool and Schendel (1987), a strategic group is defined as **the collection of organizations** adopting broadly the **same strategy to service the needs of the same group of customers**. 
- Strategic groups can be identified by **mapping the position of competitors in an industry against two competitive criteria**.


# Sessions 5-6 What Capabilities Do We Have -- The Resource-Based View

**Target**

- Explain the **importance of resources, capabilities, and activities** in organizational strategy.
- Explain how an organization can identify and compete through the **deployment** of **distinctive resources**.
- Evaluate the **potential** of an organization to **manage** its resource base over time through **dynamic** capabilities.

## The Firm’s Constituent Parts

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_STG/The Firm Constituent Parts.png" alt="The Firm’s Constituent Parts" style="zoom:60%;" />

## Framework of Resource-based View (RBV) theorizing
At the centre of RBV theorizing is a search for resources that give the organization a possible competitive edge.

This crucial conceptual framework is known as the VRIO or VRIN

**VRIO**

- Value
	- Can be used to create outputs of value to customers that they are willing to pay for (or fund, in the case of not for profit)
- Rare
	- In limited supply
	- Not available to all organizations
- Imperfectly imitable (难模仿)
	- It is not possible to copy or create the resource, or obtain the same value from other means
- Organization
	- Available in a format in which it can actually be used, if required, by the organization in its specific context

**VRIN**

- Valuable
	- Increases PUV
	- Lowers Costs
- Rare
- Inimitable
- Non-substitutable

***Resource bundles and complementarities***

> The RBV highlights that VRIO/VRIN resources are rarely, if ever, deployed on their own. Instead, resources tend to be configured in ‘bundles’ during use (Miller and Shamsie 1996). On its own a resource might enable no, or a very limited range of, capabilities. In **combination** with other resources, the potential for taking action can be significantly enhanced.

## Categories of Strategic Asset
- **Tangible Assets:** location, equipment, patents, information
- **System Assets:** operating, quality, induction, training, proposal writing
- **Structural Assets:** grouping, coordination processes, accountability
- **Knowledge Assets:** technical know-how, tacit routines, entrepreneurial insight, knowledge architecture
- **Relational Assets:** trust, reputation, brand, contracts, switching costs, social capital
- **Cultural Assets:** creativity, cooperation, responsiveness, professionalism, learning

## Distinctive and threshold capabilities
**Distinctive capabilities**

- Refer to the potential to take value-creating actions that are **not available to all competitors**.

- For a capability to be considered distinctive, it doesn’t have to be unique, just ‘**not common**’ or shared amongst competitors.

**Threshold capabilities**

- The capabilities that an organization is **required to maintain to a minimum performance** level.
- create the **conditions** in which distinctive capabilities can be **exploited**.

## Competencies

- ***Distinctive competences*** draw on **distinctive resources** to achieve outcomes that are prized by the customer (Ackermann and Eden 2011).
- ***Core competences*** describe competences that **recur** throughout an organization, underpinning value creation and strategy **across all aspects of operations** (Prahalad and Hamel (1990).
- ***Core rigidities*** describes resources which were **once valuable**, and are still considered so in strategy work, but which are in actuality a **hindrance** to organizational performance.

## Dynamic capability
- Definition: the **organizational capacity** to **create, extend, or modify** the **resource base** (Helfat et al. 2007:4). 
- Can be used to **adjust** the resource base in **reaction** to environmental **changes**, or to modify the resource base to **build** new or modified **capabilities for anticipated future needs** (Schoemaker et al. 2018).
- Dynamic capabilities are the **subset** of organizational capabilities associated with **managing or manipulating** the resource base.

## Sources of Inimitability(不可模仿性)
- Causal Ambiguity 原因不明确
- Path Dependency
- Asset Configuration 资产配置

## Cause Mapping
<img src="/assets/img/Pic_STG/Cause Mapping.png" alt="image-20201218092554639" style="zoom:45%;" />

## Strategic Asset Audit

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_STG/Strategic Asset Audit.png" alt="image-20201218092924566" style="zoom:50%;" />

| **Asset Candidate** | PUV (5) | Costs (5) | Rare (5) | Inimitable (5) | Non-Substitutable (5) | Total (25) | \*Category | **Where can it be leveraged?** |

**Summary**

- Explain the importance of building understanding of resources, capabilities, and activities in organizational strategy.
- Explain how an organization can identify and compete through the deployment of distinctive resources.
- Evaluate the potential of an organization to manage its resource base over time through dynamic capabilities.
- Appraise the configuration of an organization as a set of supporting and value-adding activities.




# Sessions 7-8 How to Compete / Gain Advantage -- The Customer Matrix

**Q: How can we win more business?**

Some notes

> Customer depends your advantage
> Utility of your product
> discover the unique advantage of your business 
> what customers what is the best value
> two variables: PUV and Price
> PERCEIVED for CUSTOMERS
> ​	How do my customers think about the price
> ​	What the customer perceived use

## Customer Matrix (PUV - PP)

**Description**
- a device to explore competitive strategy
- focused on a discrete segment of demand: *a group of potential customers with similar needs and perceptions as to which use values meet their underlying needs*
- Perceived Use Value (PUV): *the benefits that customers gain from the product/service*
- Perceived Price (PP): *the cost incurred by the customers*

### Process

1. **Dimensions of PUV Chart**
**Define** product category and customer profile to work on (Be specific).

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_STG/Dimensions of PUV Chart.png" alt="image-20201218100819281" style="zoom:67%;" />

2. **Calculating PUV Scores**
2.1. Write down the **dimensions** of Perceived Use Value (Remember these are from the customers point of view do not include price)
2.2. **Rank** the PUV dimensions in importance to customer and weight them by %. 
2.3. Select 2/3 competitors' products and construct the "dimensions of PUV" chart. **Rate** their competing product on each of the PUV dimensions relative to your own product (+3 to -3). (The rating is in terms of PUV to the customer). 
2.4. **Calculate** a PUV score for each competing product (the sum of all rating scores x weightings).

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_STG/Calculating PUV Scores.png" alt="image-20201218100920283" style="zoom:67%;" />

3. **Customer Matrix**
Plot a Customer Matrix using the PUV scores and your knowledge of prices (consider the total price to the customer, not just the initial product price).

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_STG/Customer Matrix.png" alt="image-20201218100957546" style="zoom:67%;" />

4. **Analysis: Value For Money (VFM) Curves**
What are the implications of your analysis? 
	
	> e.g. How would you describe the current competitive positioning of your business? Where might you move? How? Where may competitors move in the future? Are new entrants a possibility? If so where might they try to position themselves?

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_STG/Value For Money (VFM) Curves.png" alt="image-20201218101202831" style="zoom:67%;" />

## Issue the Customer Matrix
### Moving West $\longleftarrow$

- Price
	- You must be the lowest cost competitor $\leftarrow$
	- Or have sufficient financial strength to “stay the course”
- Cost
	- Have a good knowledge of competitors’ costs
	- Understand the key drivers of own cost base
	- Develop a low cost culture
- Perceived Use Value
	- Avoid creating the perception of reduced quality
	- Be careful not to undermine key dimensions of PUV
	- Understand the need to move north to hold position $\uparrow$

### Moving North $\uparrow$
- Perceived
	- Ensure that the value added is perceived as **valuable**
	- Use **signals** to reinforce the value added
- Make **imitation** as hard as possible
	- Use many small differentiators
	- Innovate constantly
- Control the **costs** of adding value
- Do not try to differentiate on basic “qualifiers”
- Recognise the **needs** of the **true** decision maker
- Uncover or create **unrecognised** purchase criteria
- Focus **cost reduction** where it will not jeopardise **value added**
- Do **not** add **too much** PUV – especially in a price sensitive market

#### Sources of Perceived Use Value
***(Ensure PUV dimensions reflect customers real decision making criteria)***

- Embedded Value:
Value embedded in the tangible attributes of the product/service itself
*e.g. styling of a car*
- Value-in-use:
Value co-created by the customer through the use of the product / service.
The customer’s outcome, purpose or objective that is achieved through use.
*e.g. it makes me feel young again*

## The Customer Matrix and Competitive Strategy Options

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_STG/The Customer Matrix and Competitive Strategy Options.png" alt="The Customer Matrix and Competitive Strategy Options" style="zoom: 45%;" />

## Customer Matrix: In Summary
- Customer Matrix provides insight into **competitive positioning** in terms of key business winning criteria – **Perceived Price & Perceived Use Value**
- It makes you ask questions of customers – **What they really value & How they see the market place and competition**
- It facilitates development of a clear competitive strategy – Who is the **target customer** & What is the **value proposition** you wish to offer

# Sessions 9-10 Corporate Level Strategy

## Definitions & Terminologies

### Levels of Strategy
- Corporate:
	What is the overall rationale and scope of the corporation – how can the corporate centre add value to the constituent businesses?
- Business:
	How can we compete effectively? 
	How can we deliver sustainable competitive advantage?
- Functional:
	How can the different functional operations contribute to effective implementation of business/corporate strategy?
	
### What is Corporate Strategy?
Corporate-level strategy is concerned with the **overall purpose and scope** of an organisation, which businesses it is in, and how **value will be added** to the different businesses of the organisation

### SBU: Strategical Business Unit

## Corporate Strategy: Key Questions

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_STG/Corporate Strategy - Key Questions.png" alt="Corporate Strategy - Key Questions" style="zoom:40%;" />

### What is the corporate purpose?
#### The Notion of Corporate Parenting
- Corporations **create value** by 'parenting' the businesses (SBUs) they own
- The best parent companies **create more value** than any of their rivals would if they owned the same businesses: These companies have a **parenting advantage**
- Parenting advantage occurs when the parent's capabilities and resources **fit** well with the needs and opportunities of the businesses
- Therefore corporations should build **portfolios** of businesses **around the parent organisation’s capabilities and resources**

**Conglomerates(联合大企业) Still Valued in Emerging Markets**
*Overcome relative lack of institutional infrastructure:*

- External risk capital harder to access, e.g. developing capital markets 
- Consumers may favour big 'umbrella' brands, due to perceived lack of confidence in regulatory standards
- Political influence: critical mass of lobbying capability to negotiate bureaucratic processes

### How do we add value to our SBUs?

**The Corporate Value Creation Logics ---- Five ways to add value**

Governance-based logics
1. **Financial Control**

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_STG/Financial Control.png" style="zoom:67%;" />

Cost-based logics
2. **Consolidation of support activities**(合并支持活动)

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_STG/Consolidation of Support Activities.png" style="zoom:67%;" />

3. **Scale in core processes**

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_STG/Scale in Core Processes.png" style="zoom:67%;" />

Knowledge-based logics
4. **Leverage of best practice (Knowledge Transfer)**

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_STG/Leverage of Best Practice.png" alt="image-20201218112946743" style="zoom:67%;" />

4. **Creative integration (Innovation)**

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_STG/Creative Integration - Innovation.png" style="zoom:67%;" />



#### Value Realisation and the Corporate Value Logic

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_STG/Value Realisation and the Corporate Value Logic.png" alt="Value Realisation and the Corporate Value Logic" style="zoom:40%;" />

### What is the *desired* portfolio of SBUs? & What is the *current* portfolio of SBUs?

***Evaluating Fit within the Corporate Portfolio: The Corporate Parenting Matrix***

#### Assessing Corporate-SBU Fit
"Fit between a parent and its businesses is a two-edged sword: a good fit can create value; a bad one can destroy it" (Goold, Campbell & Alexander, 1995)
1. How well do the parent’s characteristics fit the businesses’ parenting opportunities? [“benefit”]
	- this indicates the potential for value creation
	- consider the parent’s capabilities (including its primary 'value creation logic') and the parenting opportunities for the business unit 
2. How well do the parent’s characteristics fit with the businesses’ critical success factors? [“feel”]
	- A lack of “feel” indicates potential for value destruction
	- consider the parent’s corporate culture and that required for the business unit’s success.


#### The Corporate Parenting Matrix

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_STG/Evaluating the Fit in the Corporate Portfolio.png" alt="Evaluating the Fit in the Corporate Portfolio" style="zoom:40%;" />

- **Heartland** businesses are ones to which the parent can add value without danger of doing harm. They should be at the **core** of future strategy.
- **Ballast** businesses are ones the parent **understands well but can do little for**. They would probably be just as successful as independent companies and may be worth more to other corporate parents who could add value to them. If they are part of a future corporate strategy, they need to be managed with a light touch and bear as little cost of the corporate bureaucracy as possible.
- **Value trap** businesses are **dangerous**. They appear attractive because there are opportunities for the parent to add value, but the parents’ characteristics **do not fit well** with the SBUs critical success factors. Value trap businesses should only be included in the future strategy if they can be moved into the heartland, and hence if the parent can adjust its characteristics (unlikely!)
- **Alien** businesses are clear **misfits**. They offer little opportunity to add value and they do not fit with the parent’s characteristics. **Divestment** is the best strategy before value in the SBU is destroyed.

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_STG/Culture Web.png" alt="Culture Web" style="zoom:25%;" />

<center>Culture Web</center>


#### *Some Implications*
- **Divesting Alien** businesses is important to avoid value destruction within the portfolio.
- Higher value creation comes from **focusing on Heartland** businesses and **fine-tuning** parenting capabilities **to best match** the parenting opportunities of the Heartland businesses. 
- This reinforces the need to refine the corporation’s structure, systems and culture to best facilitate its favoured value creation logic.
- Value trap businesses might suggest that the corporate centre should adjust its characteristics to improve its ‘feel’ for the businesses. But is it realistic for the centre to behave in different ways towards different businesses? Some SBU managers are likely to see this as unfair (two sets of rules) and it dilutes the focus required for optimal parenting of Heartland businesses. 
- Businesses are **dynamic**. The Matrix requires regular review as the critical success factors of the SBUs change with their environments and the parent develops new capabilities.

# Sessions 11-12 Strategic Decision-making

**Target**

- Distinguish **strategic decisions** from **routine decisions**.
- Analyse the differences between **rational** and **cognitive** approaches to decision-making in organizations.
- Evaluate the impact of **common heuristics** and **biases** on organizational decision-making.
- Examine and practice tools and techniques available for managers to improve the quality of their decision-making processes – **cognitive mapping**

## Routine decisions and strategic decisions

> **Mintzberg et al. (1976):**
> strategic decisions are large, expensive, and precedent-setting decisions that are made under conditions of ambiguity and uncertainty about the final decision outcome.

**Characteristics of Strategic Decisions** (Nutt and Wilson, 2010):

- They deal with complex problems which are hard to define.
- The outcomes are risky and shrouded in uncertainty and ambiguity.
- They rarely have one best solution, but rather a series of possible solutions.
- They involve trade-offs and the setting of organizational priorities, as scarce resources have to be allocated to a possible solution to the problem.
- They are influenced by competing political interests that may bias decision makers towards a solution that aligns with their preferences.
- They are often connected with other organizational problems, which warrant additional decision-making.

## The six-step rational decision-making model
The ‘rational’ decision-making model prescribes us to apply the following six steps to each scenario (Bazerman and Moore 2009)
1. Define the problem
2. Identify decision criteria
3. Weigh the criteria
4. Generate alternatives
5. Rate each alternative on each criterion
6. Compute the optimal decision

## The bounds of rationality (理性的界限)

> - Herbert Simon suggested that all human judgement is bounded (or limited) in its rationality, and we can better understand decision-making by describing and explaining actual decisions rather than by focusing on what should be done rationally in decision-making processes (March and Simon 1958). 
> - While Simon’s framework of ‘bounded rationality’ views people as attempting to make rational decisions, it acknowledges that there are limitations that prevent us from making rational decisions as prescribed by the rational decision-making model.
> - Satisficing (satisfactory and sufficient)

## Managerial heuristics (启发式管理)
When we make decision, two things are happening:
**System One & System Two thinking (思考快与慢)**

|System One thinking | System Two thinking |
| :---- | :---- |
| Intuitive | Reflective |
| Automatic | Requires a concerted effort |
| Produces a constant representation of the world around us | Activated when we are faced with problems where the stakes are high |
| Leads to action: effortless, and leads us to do things, and form instant opinions | Slow, deliberate |

**Common heuristics (常见的启发式)**

| Heuristic | Definition | Example |
|:----|:----|:----|
|Representativeness|A tendency to assume that what we see or will see is typical of what can occur|Assumption that colleagues who act in a friendly manner, are genuinely friendly and cooperative|
|Availability|A tendency to assume that what could happen in a new situation will be the same as what we have seen or experienced in the past|assumption that the acquisition under consideration will work out as well as our previously well executed acquisition|
|Anchoring and adjustment|A tendency to make judgements based on an initial assessment as an anchor, but failing to make sufficient adjustments later on as new information is revealed|contract price negotiation becomes anchored on the initial cost quoted by the contractor rather than on a fully objective cost assessment|
|Affect|A tendency to allow emotions such as fear and pleasure to guide our decision-making|Negative feelings about nuclear power may lead to overstating its risks and understating its benefits|


## Collective decision-making
- **Devil’s advocacy**
	Devil’s advocacy involves a group developing a solid argument for a recommended course of action and subjecting that recommendation to an in-depth formal critique.
- **Dialectical enquiry**
	Essentially, dialectical enquiry is a debate between two opposing sets of viewpoints. Although it stimulates programmed conflict, it is a constructive approach because it elicits the benefits and limitations of opposing sets of ideas.
- **Consensus decision-making**
	A consensus approach is one where the agreement of the whole group is sought for a decision.
- **The Delphi method**
	The Delphi method allows experts to work towards a mutual agreement by conducting and circulating series of questionnaires and releasing related feedback to further the discussion with each subsequent round. The experts’ responses shift as rounds are completed, based on the information produced by other experts participating in the analysis
## Cognitive mapping
- Cognitive mapping, causal mapping, is a simple and useful technique for addressing situations where thinking, individual or group, matters:
	- it can help an individual understand a situation better and act effectively on it
	- it can help groups build a better understanding of a strategic problem and create effective action.
- A causal map is a word-and-arrow diagram in which ideas and actions are causally linked with one another.
- The arrows indicate how one idea or action leads to another.

## Characteristics of mapping
- Cognitive mapping help people to think in natural way
	constructing, elaborating, revising, and re-revising a system of interconnected concepts (“constructs”)
- The concepts embody a set of comparisons and contrasts:
	To know what something is, we need to know at least one thing it is like - the **comparison** - and one thing it is not like -the **contrast**; this leads us to:
	- make sense of our world;
	- create distinctions that make a difference;
	- anticipate the future;
	- take action based on our anticipations;
	- make sense of the results of out actions;
	- begin again in a context that is in some sense different, at least partially as a result of our actions.

# Sessions 13-14 Business Recovery

**Target**
- To understand the **notion** of business recovery 
	- how can firms make **sustained recoveries** following a period of relative decline
	- the **strategic issues faced** in a business recovery situation
- To build awareness of the **findings from empirical research**(*实证研究*) on business recovery strategies

## 1. Case: **Harley-Davidson Motorcycles** (HD)

The performance

## 2. Input: lessons from business recovery research

*Case studies*:

> 22 empirical studies
>
> UK: 1973-1992; US: 1973-1082
>
> 1300 business recoveries

Definition of Successful Recovery: moving from low or declining ROI(Return On Investment) to growing ROI sustained over at least two year period

### **Effective Recovery Strategies: key elements identified by prior research** 

#### 1. Pursuit of *Cost Efficiencies* 
- **Belt-tightening** to stabilise position / improve cash flow
- Frequently includes **review** of firm’s financial structure (e.g. to relieve pressure of short term debt repayments) 
- ***Over-pursuit*** of cost efficiencies can damage customer value proposition and employee morale
- Similarly, dangers in ***focusing sole on*** R&D / training etc
- **Focus** should be on elimination of **high cost** activities that deliver **little customer value**

**Use the PUV to identifying candidates**

#### 2. Asset Retrenchment / Divestment *资产缩减/剥离*
- **Review** of all activities to assess financial contribution
- **Divestment** of low profitability activities
- Impact on **remaining** activities needs to be **evaluated** to avoid loss of strategic capability
- **Realistic assessment** of **likely** sale proceeds required 
- Proceeds can be **reinvested** in strengthening core business
#### 3. Focus on *Core* Activities
- **Focus** on markets, products and customers with **greatest profit potential**
- Consider your **best** known product lines, **most** loyal / least price sensitive customer segments, areas of distinctive **competitive** strength 
- Once defined, develop **a clear competitive strategy** based on understanding of customer needs
- Closer customer relationships, increased focus on marketing, broadening sales channels, optimising service, all associated with success
#### 4. Build for *Future* Growth
- Only once financial stability assured 
- Typically based on controlled growth of core business into new customer segments or geographic territories
- Requires recognition and leverage of **existing** strategic capabilities
- Long term sustainability will require ambidexterity: continued pursuit of efficiency in core business with simultaneous development of capacity for innovation and adaptation.
#### 5. Reinvigoration of Firm *Leadership*
- Build committed and positive management approach
- Often via replacement of CEO / Top Management Team
    - signals crisis and need for change
    - historic mental models may no longer be appropriate
    - Existing leadership may not recognise need to change if it challenges past decisions/investments
- Need to **balance** leadership change with potential internal disruption and loss of market knowledge.
- Overall, successful recovery associated with "**bias for action**"
#### 6. *Culture* Change
- Typically, in concert with leadership change 
- May be necessary to challenge outdated assumptions
- Reinforces adaptation and new market realities 
- Challenging cultural "symbols" can be key to change
#### Summary: Effective Recovery Strategies (key elements identified by prior research) 
- Focus on the **core business** coupled with **retrenchment** from **unprofitable** activities
- **Clear and improved** competitive positioning within the core business, with a **distinctive value** proposition based on an understanding of customer needs
- **Strong cost control**, which focuses on the elimination of high cost activities that deliver little customer value
- A positive and committed **management approach**, often achieved through leadership and accompanying culture change
- Controlled **future** development, with growth pursued only once financial stability restored and then based on recognition and leveraging of the firm’s underlying strategic capabilities

- Failed after 6 months of active business causing investors to lose almost US\$128 million. 
- Boo.com was first of a string of high profile dot.com failures in early 2000s and its failure had strong repercussions for dot.com investments.

**Experience**
April 99: Initial financing complete. Implied valuation of \$240m
May 99: 150 staff in offices in London, New York, Stockholm, Paris, Amsterdam, Munich. Original launch date missed
July 99: 200 staff. Fortune: "One of 50 coolest companies" 2nd launch date missed

Feb 2000: Burn rate remains > ​\$1m per week Sales < ​\$1m per month New CFO Dean Hawkins resigns after 2 months
May 2000: Boo.com closes. ​\$128m of investors funds lost!

## 2. Were there early warning signs? 

**Early Warning Signs**
1. **Unnecessary complexity**
- Is the company’s organizational structure convoluted or complex?
- Is its strategy unnecessarily complex for an otherwise simple problem?
- Is its accounting overly complicated, non-transparent, or nonstandard?
- Is it employing complicated or nonstandard terminology?

2. **Speeding out of control**
- Does the management team have enough experience to handle growth?
- Are there small, yet nontrivial, details of problems that seem to be getting overlooked by management?
- Is management ignoring warnings now that could lead to problems later?
- Is the company so successful or so dominant that it’s no longer in touch with what it needs to do to remain on top?
- Do the unplanned departures of senior executives signify deeper problems?

3. **The distracted CEO**
- Do I have unanswered questions about the CEO’s background and talent?
- Is the CEO spending too much money to fulfil personal missions that don’t necessarily benefit the company?
- Are company leaders so consumed by money and greed that they’re taking questionable or inappropriate actions?
4. **Excessive hype**
- Is it possible that the excitement around the company’s new product is just hype?
- Could the excitement around the company’s merger or acquisition be hype?
- Is the excitement around the company’s prospects just unfulfilled hype?
- Is the latest missed milestone part of a pattern that could signify deeper problems?

5. **A question of character: trust**
- Are the CEO and other senior executives so aggressive or overconfident that I 
don’t really trust them?

**Reacting to Early Warning Signs Depends on…..**
- Your personal risk tolerance
- The socio-political environment

**Strategic Leadership is NOT Strategic Planning**
➢ It is generally impossible to forecast the future!
➢ Strategy needs to be based in the present (the “here and now”)
➢ “The core of strategy work is discovering the critical factors in a situation and designing a way of co-ordinating and focusing actions to deal with these factors.” *(Rumelt, 2011)*

**Good Strategy involves:**

- An insightful diagnosis of the situation at hand
- An overall approach (guiding policy) for dealing with the critical issues 
- A set of coherent actions


## 3. Could Boo.com have been turned around? 

**Summary: Effective Recovery Strategies (key elements identified by prior research) **
*From Session 13-14*

- Focus on the **core business** coupled with **retrenchment** from **unprofitable** activities
- **Clear and improved** competitive positioning within the core business, with a **distinctive value** proposition based on an understanding of customer needs
- **Strong cost control**, which focuses on the elimination of high cost activities that deliver little customer value
- A positive and committed **management approach**, often achieved through leadership and accompanying culture change
- Controlled **future** development, with growth pursued only once financial stability restored and then based on recognition and leveraging of the firm’s underlying strategic capabilities

## 4. Why do smart executives sometimes fail: The seven habits of spectacularly unsuccessful executives

**"Why Smart Executives Fail" Study**  *(Finkelstein, 2003)* 

> - Focus on strategic failure and the lessons to be learnt
> - Professor Sydney Finkelstein, Steven Roth Professor of Management, Tuck Business School, Dartmouth College
> - Six year research programme 1997-2003
> - Sample: 51 companies suffering "major business failure" - cross-section of industries, some non-US
> - Data Sources: 
> 	- company reports & accounts
> 	- press/analysts reports
> 	- 197 interviews with executives

> - "We're talking about people whose failures were breathtakingly gigantic, who have taken world-renowned business operations and made them almost worthless."
> - "Remarkably enough, it's possible to identify seven habits that characterise spectacularly unsuccessful people. Nearly all the leaders who preside over major business failures exhibit five or six of these habits. Many all seven."
> - "Even more remarkable, each of these habits represents a quality that is widely admired in today’s business world"



1. They see themselves and their companies as **dominating their environments.** 
2. They identify so completely with their company that there is **no clear boundary** between personal and corporate interests.
3. They think they have **all** the **answers**.
4. They ruthlessly **eliminate** anyone who isn’t 100% behind them. 
5. They are consummate company **spokespersons**, obsessed with the company **image**. 
6. They **underestimate** major obstacles.
7. They stubbornly rely on what worked for them in the **past**.



> - "Remarkably enough, it's possible to identify seven habits that characterise spectacularly unsuccessful people. Nearly all the leaders who preside over major business failures exhibit five or six of these habits. Many all seven."
> - "Learning to recognise these habits is the first step toward finding ways to compensate for them"



**Some implications**

- *As Leaders:* Are you liable to slip into any of the habits? 
- *As Non-Exec Directors:* Is one or more of the habits having an undue influence on the CEO’s behaviour?Are these early warning signs?
- *As Investors:* Be aware!

## Organizational ambidexterity and strategic leadership

- Organizational ambidexterity *(组织双元性)*
	- Most successful businesses are better at refining their current offerings than at pioneering radically new future products and services (O’Reilly and Tushman 2004).
	- In turbulent markets, firms need be able to move quickly towards new opportunities, adjust to volatile markets, and avoid complacency (Birkinshaw and Gibson 2004).
	- O’Reilly and Tushman (2004) have termed such adaptability as organizational ambidexterity, which can be defined as capability of the organization to simultaneously exploit existing competencies (exploitation) and explore new opportunities (exploration).

## What is strategic change? We can consider change to be strategic if it results in:
- changes to the competitive position of the firm.
- changes to the firm's overarching business model.
- changes to the firm's product and service offer.
- development of new organizational capabilities.
- changes to the geographic scope of the firm through international expansion.
- outsourcing of activities or bringing activities in-house that have previously been carried out by outside suppliers.
- changes to the nature and overall structure of the organization through the formation of strategic alliances, mergers and acquisitions, divestments, etc

## Barriers to change
- Social and political structures
- Organizational routines
- Institutional isomorphism*(同构)*
- Bounded rationality and satisficing
- Equilibrium-seeking behaviour

## How the need for change emerges
**Strategic Drift**

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_STG/Strategic Drift.png" alt="Strategic Drift" style="zoom: 67%;" />

**Occurs when strategic thinking is out of touch with business environment**

## Models for managing change
### **Forcefield analysis**

- Examples of forces for change are:
	- new management and/or employees
	- changing market and customer tastes
	- new technology
	- competition
	- changing regulatory environment
	- public opinion.
- Examples of forces resisting change are:
	- individual’s fear of failure
	- organizational politics and turf wars
	- organizational apathy and inertia
	- hostility to management
	- change fatigue.

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_STG/Forcefield Analysis.png" alt="Forcefield Analysis" style="zoom:67%;" />

### Change Model - John Kotter’s 8 Steps Model

**Step 1: Create Urgency**

For change to happen, it helps if the whole company really wants it. Develop a sense of urgency around the need for change. This may help you spark the initial motivation to get things moving.

This isn’t simply a matter of showing people poor sales statistics or talking about increased competition. Open an honest and convincing dialogue about what’s happening in the marketplace and with your competition. If many people start talking about the change you propose, the urgency can build and feed on itself.

What you can do:

\- Identify potential threats, and develop scenarios showing what could happen in the future.

\- Examine opportunities that should be, or could be, exploited.

\- Start honest discussions, and give dynamic and convincing reasons to get people talking and thinking.

\- Request support from customers, outside stakeholders and industry people to strengthen your argument.

Kotter suggests that for change to be successful, 75% of a company’s management needs to “buy into” the change. In other words, you have to really work hard on Step One, and spend significant time and energy building urgency, before moving onto the next steps. Don’t panic and jump in too fast because you don’t want to risk further short-term losses – if you act without proper preparation, you could be in for a very bumpy ride.

**Step 2: Form a Powerful Coalition(联合)**

Convince people that change is necessary. This often takes strong leadership and visible support from key people within your organization. Managing change isn’t enough – you have to lead it.

You can find effective change leaders throughout your organization – they don’t necessarily follow the traditional company hierarchy. To lead change, you need to bring together a coalition, or team, of influential people whose power comes from a variety of sources, including job title, status, expertise, and political importance.

Once formed, your “change coalition” needs to work as a team, continuing to build urgency and momentum around the need for change.

What you can do:

\- Identify the true leaders in your organization.

\- Ask for an emotional commitment from these key people.

\- Work on team building within your change coalition.

Check your team for weak areas, and ensure that you have a good mix of people from different departments and different levels within your company.

**Step 3: Create a Vision for Change**

When you first start thinking about change, there will probably be many great ideas and solutions floating around. Link these concepts to an overall vision that people can grasp easily and remember.

A clear vision can help everyone understand why you’re asking them to do something. When people see for themselves what you’re trying to achieve, then the directives they’re given tend to make more sense.

What you can do:

\- Determine the values that are central to the change.

\- Develop a short summary (one or two sentences) that captures what you “see” as the future of your organization.

\- Create a strategy to execute that vision.

\- Ensure that your change coalition can describe the vision in five minutes or less.

\- Practice your “vision speech” often.

**Step 4: Communicate the Vision**

What you do with your vision after you create it will determine your success. Your message will probably have strong competition from other day-to-day communications within the company, so you need to communicate it frequently and powerfully, and embed it within everything that you do.

Don’t just call special meetings to communicate your vision. Instead, talk about it every chance you get. Use the vision daily to make decisions and solve problems. When you keep it fresh on everyone’s minds, they’ll remember it and respond to it.

It’s also important to “walk the talk.” What you do is far more important – and believable – than what you say. Demonstrate the kind of behavior that you want from others.

What you can do:

\- Talk often about your change vision.

\- Openly and honestly address peoples’ concerns and anxieties.

\- Apply your vision to all aspects of operations – from training to performance reviews. Tie everything back to the vision.

\- Lead by example.

**Step 5: Remove Obstacles**

If you follow these steps and reach this point in the change process, you’ve been talking about your vision and building buy-in from all levels of the organization. Hopefully, your staff wants to get busy and achieve the benefits that you’ve been promoting.

But is anyone resisting the change? And are there processes or structures that are getting in its way?

Put in place the structure for change, and continually check for barriers to it. Removing obstacles can empower the people you need to execute your vision, and it can help the change move forward.

What you can do:

\- Identify, or hire, change leaders whose main roles are to deliver the change.

\- Look at your organizational structure, job descriptions, and performance and compensation systems to ensure they’re in line with your vision.

\- Recognize and reward people for making change happen.

\- Identify people who are resisting the change, and help them see what’s needed.

\- Take action to quickly remove barriers (human or otherwise).

**Step 6: Create Short-term Wins**

Nothing motivates more than success. Give your company a taste of victory early in the change process. Within a short time frame (this could be a month or a year, depending on the type of change), you’ll want to have results that your staff can see. Without this, critics and negative thinkers might hurt your progress.

Create short-term targets – not just one long-term goal. You want each smaller target to be achievable, with little room for failure. Your change team may have to work very hard to come up with these targets, but each “win” that you produce can further motivate the entire staff.

What you can do:

\- Look for sure-fire projects that you can implement without help from any strong critics of the change.

\- Don’t choose early targets that are expensive. You want to be able to justify the investment in each project.

\- Thoroughly analyze the potential pros and cons of your targets. If you don’t succeed with an early goal, it can hurt your entire change initiative.

\- Reward the people who help you meet the targets.

**Step 7: Build on the Change**

Kotter argues that many change projects fail because victory is declared too early. Real change runs deep. Quick wins are only the beginning of what needs to be done to achieve long-term change.

Launching one new product using a new system is great. But if you can launch 10 products, that means the new system is working. To reach that 10th success, you need to keep looking for improvements.

Each success provides an opportunity to build on what went right and identify what you can improve.

What you can do:

\- After every win, analyze what went right and what needs improving.

\- Set goals to continue building on the momentum you’ve achieved.

\- Learn about kaizen, the idea of continuous improvement.

\- Keep ideas fresh by bringing in new change agents and leaders for your change coalition.

**Step 8: Anchor the Changes in Corporate Culture**

Finally, to make any change stick, it should become part of the core of your organization. Your corporate culture often determines what gets done, so the values behind your vision must show in day-to-day work.

Make continuous efforts to ensure that the change is seen in every aspect of your organization. This will help give that change a solid place in your organization’s culture.

It’s also important that your company’s leaders continue to support the change. This includes existing staff and new leaders who are brought in. If you lose the support of these people, you might end up back where you started.

What you can do:

\- Talk about progress every chance you get. Tell success stories about the change process, and repeat other stories that you hear.

\- Include the change ideals and values when hiring and training new staff.

\- Publicly recognize key members of your original change coalition, and make sure the rest of the staff – new and old – remembers their contributions.

\- Create plans to replace key leaders of change as they move on. This will help ensure that their legacy is not lost or forgotten.



## Paradigm

***范式***

### The Role of the Paradigm

Underpin organisational culture, because it is the way that you THINK that governs the way that you ACT.
As managers, paradigms

- Provide the **lens** through which you see the world
- Create **boundaries** you are not always aware of
- Help you **identify and stick** to recipes for success

### The Paradigms made up of
- Assumptions
- Values and beliefs
that are held in common and taken for granted
"The way we do things around here"
"The status quo"

### Organisational Paradigms
- are developed as a result of **past** experiences
- **shape current** thoughts and actions
- are **inevitable** *(不可避免的)*
- have an **impact** on organizational performance

"Culture eats strategy for breakfast." -- Peter Drucker

## Culture web
<img src="/assets/img/Pic_STG/Culture Web.png" alt="Culture web" style="zoom:50%;" />

### Examples
#### An example of A Partnership
<img src="/assets/img/Pic_STG/An example of A Partnership.png" alt="An example of A Partnership" style="zoom: 50%;" />

#### An example of A UK retail bank
<img src="/assets/img/Pic_STG/An example of A UK retail bank.png" alt="An example of A UK retail bank" style="zoom:50%;" />

### Implications
- Organisational culture can be a source of competitive advantage, or the cause of strategic drift
- If you don’t manage the culture, it may ‘manage’ you, but is it manageable? (where is the starting point?)
- Can’t just change structure and control systems - all the elements need to be used
- Need to identify what is espoused and what is real

What do people really pay attention to?

### Use of Culture Web
**Defining A Change Agenda Or "Journey"**
