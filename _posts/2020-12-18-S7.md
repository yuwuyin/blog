# Sessions 7-8 How to Compete / Gain Advantage -- The Customer Matrix

**Q: How can we win more business?**

Some notes

> Customer depends your advantage
> Utility of your product
> discover the unique advantage of your business 
> what customers what is the best value
> two variables: PUV and Price
> PERCEIVED for CUSTOMERS
> ​	How do my customers think about the price
> ​	What the customer perceived use

## Customer Matrix (PUV - PP)

**Description**
- a device to explore competitive strategy
- focused on a discrete segment of demand: *a group of potential customers with similar needs and perceptions as to which use values meet their underlying needs*
- Perceived Use Value (PUV): *the benefits that customers gain from the product/service*
- Perceived Price (PP): *the cost incurred by the customers*

### Process

1. **Dimensions of PUV Chart**
**Define** product category and customer profile to work on (Be specific).

2. **Calculating PUV Scores**
2.1. Write down the **dimensions** of Perceived Use Value (Remember these are from the customers point of view do not include price)
2.2. **Rank** the PUV dimensions in importance to customer and weight them by %. 
2.3. Select 2/3 competitors' products and construct the "dimensions of PUV" chart. **Rate** their competing product on each of the PUV dimensions relative to your own product (+3 to -3). (The rating is in terms of PUV to the customer). 
2.4. **Calculate** a PUV score for each competing product (the sum of all rating scores x weightings).

3. **Customer Matrix**
Plot a Customer Matrix using the PUV scores and your knowledge of prices (consider the total price to the customer, not just the initial product price).

4. **Analysis: Value For Money (VFM) Curves**
What are the implications of your analysis? 
	
	> e.g. How would you describe the current competitive positioning of your business? Where might you move? How? Where may competitors move in the future? Are new entrants a possibility? If so where might they try to position themselves?

## Issue the Customer Matrix
### Moving West $\longleftarrow$

- Price
	- You must be the lowest cost competitor $\leftarrow$
	- Or have sufficient financial strength to “stay the course”
- Cost
	- Have a good knowledge of competitors’ costs
	- Understand the key drivers of own cost base
	- Develop a low cost culture
- Perceived Use Value
	- Avoid creating the perception of reduced quality
	- Be careful not to undermine key dimensions of PUV
	- Understand the need to move north to hold position $\uparrow$

### Moving North $\uparrow$
- Perceived
	- Ensure that the value added is perceived as **valuable**
	- Use **signals** to reinforce the value added
- Make **imitation** as hard as possible
	- Use many small differentiators
	- Innovate constantly
- Control the **costs** of adding value
- Do not try to differentiate on basic “qualifiers”
- Recognise the **needs** of the **true** decision maker
- Uncover or create **unrecognised** purchase criteria
- Focus **cost reduction** where it will not jeopardise **value added**
- Do **not** add **too much** PUV – especially in a price sensitive market

#### Sources of Perceived Use Value
***(Ensure PUV dimensions reflect customers real decision making criteria)***

- Embedded Value:
Value embedded in the tangible attributes of the product/service itself
*e.g. styling of a car*
- Value-in-use:
Value co-created by the customer through the use of the product / service.
The customer’s outcome, purpose or objective that is achieved through use.
*e.g. it makes me feel young again*

## Customer Matrix: In Summary
- Customer Matrix provides insight into **competitive positioning** in terms of key business winning criteria – **Perceived Price & Perceived Use Value**
- It makes you ask questions of customers – **What they really value & How they see the market place and competition**
- It facilitates development of a clear competitive strategy – Who is the **target customer** & What is the **value proposition** you wish to offer
