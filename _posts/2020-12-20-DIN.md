## 1.1. Innovation, Strategy & Ecosystems

**Target**

- Definition
- Strategies
- Ecosystem

### Definition of Innovation

> - The implementation of a **new or significantly improved** product (good or service), or process, a new marketing method, or a new organisational method in business practices, workplace organisation or external relations. ~ (OECD and EUROSTAT 2005:47) 
> - Innovation is the **successful exploitation of new ideas** ~(UK Department of Trade and Industry 2004) 

#### Dimensions of Innovation

| **Incremental -> Breakthrough -> Radical** |
| --------------- |
| **Organisation -> Sector ->  World** |

#### Innovation Ambition Matrix

#### 3 litmus Tests for Disruptive Innovation

1. Can the idea be a new market disruption? 

   Is there a large population of people who historically have not had the money, equipment or skill to do this thing? And as a result have gone without it altogether or have needed to pay someone with more expertise to do it for them? 

2. Potential for low-end disruption? 
   - Are there customers at the low end of the market who would be happy to purchase a product with less (but good enough) performance if they could get it at a lower price? 
   - Can we create a business model that enables us to earn attractive profits a the discount prices required to win the business of these overserved customer at the low end? 

3. Is the innovation disruptive to all of the significant incumbent firms in the industry? 

### Innovation Strategies

**Intellectual Property Centred**

# S2. Technology
## 2.1. Technology Development, Innovation & Adoption

**Target**

- Analyse how technological trajectories and their paths influence technological innovation. 
- Use techniques to understand levels of technological progress and readiness. 
- Apply Rogers’ model of innovation diffusion to improve the innovation process and address adoption barriers. 

Technology S-Curves
- Bundles of technology & knowledge. 
- Measured by one or more performance indicators. 
- Each performance indicator will improve as effort is put into development. 
- Improvement generally follows an s-curve. 
- Time is not a good proxy for effort. 
- Development follows a trajectory.

### Technological Innovation: Key Concepts

- Continuous Improvement
- Dominant Design
- Interpretive Flexibility
- Lock-In

### Technology Readiness Level 

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_DIN/Technology Readiness Level 1.png" alt="Technology Readiness Level" style="zoom:80%;" />

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_DIN/Technology Readiness Level 2.png" alt="Technology Readiness Level" style="zoom:60%;" />

### Minimum Viable Product

- The minimum viable product is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort. 
- Core features sufficient to deploy the product, and no more. 

**Why take this approach? **
- Get in early 
- Learn from customers 
- Use feedback for trajectory of technology 
- Use feedback for trajectory of products

### Diffusion of Innovation
> Diffusion – the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social group. 

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_DIN/Diffusion of Innovation.png" alt="Diffusion of Innovation" style="zoom:50%;" />

| **No.** | **Factor**         | **Relationship**                                             | **Questions to Ask**                                         |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1       | Relative Advantage | The greater the perceived advantage, the faster the diffusion. | What new benefits does the innovation offer? Does the innovation cover all of the benefits of the existing product, process or service? How much better is the innovation, in terms of financial time saved and other measures? |
| 2       | Observability      | The easier it is to observe the advantages, the faster the diffusion. | How can the benefits of the innovation be made as tangible and demonstrable as possible? |
| 3       | Trialability       | The easier it is for users to test the innovation, the faster the diffusion. | Is the customer easily able to trial the innovation to perceive the benefits first hand? Can a trial on a small scale be used? |
| 4       | Compatibility      | The closer the match to the existing product, process or service, the faster the diffusion. | In what ways can the innovation be made similar to the customer’s current way of working? |
| 5       | Complexity         | The simpler the innovation appears, the faster the diffusion. | How can an innovation be designed to be simple? How can extra features and customization be developed in the product, process or service without adding unnecessary complexity? |
| 6       | Perceived Risk     | The lower the risk the faster the diffusion.                 | What are the customer’s perceived risks of adoption? How can they be minimized? |

### Sustaining and Disruptive Innovation
Changes Industry Structure Attractive on a different dimension Commercialised initially in 
i.e. new business models of performance, e.g. smaller, simpler emerging markets – not attractive cheaper, more convenient to existing ‘best’ customers 

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_DIN/Sustaining and Disruptive Innovation.png" alt="Sustaining and Disruptive Innovation" style="zoom:67%;" />


**Summary**
- Technological development tends to mature with effort in the trend of an S-curve.
- Technology Readiness Levels can be used to monitor a technologies development. 
- Diffusion of innovation within a market tends to follow a bell curve and there are 6 key factors which can facilitate adoption. 


## 2.2. Technology Roadmapping

**Target**
- Recognise how innovative products rely on the: 
	- Development of technological capabilities 
	- Emergence of specific market and business drivers 
- Map technology push and market pull onto a roadmap.

### Introduction

- Key challenge in managing technological innovation 
	- Match market requirements to technology opportunities. 
	- Combine “Push & Pull” 
- Products often rely on combining many technologies. 
- Roadmapping seeks to: 
	- Map the timing of events that affect development of products. 
	- Show the inter-relationships between events. 
	- Link technology capabilities and markets. 

### Purpose to plan: 

- New products 
- Development of new capabilities 
- Creation of collaborations & partnerships 
- Connect past & future 

### Example: Technology Roadmap for Activity Monitors

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_DIN/Technology Roadmap for Activity Monitors.png" style="zoom:60%;" />

### Technology Roadmap Table

|      | Past | Present | Future |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ------ |
| Business/Market Drivers, Objectives |  |  |  |  |
| Products, Services, Systems, Opportunities |  |  |  |  |
| Capabilities, Technologies |  |  |  |  |
| Skills, Partnerships, Programmes |  |  |  |  |

**Use PESTLE research for Roadmapping**

# S3 Value Proposition

**Target**

- Understand how to define a value proposition. 
- Review methods to uncover user needs. 
- Identify value added between different categories of jobs. 

### Value Proposition
A short statement which is a **pitch** to show why your business is worth investing in: 
- What are your customers needs? 
- What solution are you offering? 
- How are you different/better to what else is on the market right now? 

**Tools**
- How to create interest? 
- What differentiates your offer from your competitors' ? 
- How to increases the quantity and quality of your sales leads ? 

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_DIN/Value Proposition.png" alt="Value Proposition" style="zoom:67%;" />

**Benefits rather than Features**
Most designers/engineers/technologists think about the features of their products. For a value proposition think about the **benefits from these features**. 

Markets that do not exist cannot be analysed. Your customers are not identical. 
- Think about your target demographic. 
- Your range in that demographic. 
- Empathise with them. 

### Depths of knowledge

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_DIN/Depths of knowledge.png" alt="Depths of knowledge" style="zoom: 67%;" />

Root cause analysis; keep asking why.

### Tools for Innovation

- **Qualitative Surveys**
Structured questions to find your target demographics root needs, desires and behaviour.  i.e. interviews, focus groups, customer feedback 

- **Quantitative Surveys (Market data/trends)**
i.e. published reports; Deloitte, WHO, Financial Times 

- **User Cases & Storyboards**
Create multiple personas and sketch a comic of how they currently solve their problem. Immerse yourself into their user behaviour. 

- **User Observations**
What people say, isn’t necessarily what they do or what they mean! 
Watch people to evaluate their behaviour and their actions. 
You can observe pain points in existing solutions. 
i.e. usability studies, eyetracking. 

- **Benchmarking** (基准化分析法)
When you don’t know where to start, or you want to improve on an existing design, or outperform a competitor. Conduct a series of tests of an existing design to evaluate the Key Performance Indicators. This can include Usability studies. 

> Use a combination of qualitative, quantitative and anecdotal information to immerse yourself and have a depth of the real need.

Evolution or Revolution, Iteration vs. Innovation

Tools for **Capturing User Needs**

- Qualitative Surveys
- Quantitative Surveys (Market data/trends)
- User Cases & Storyboards
- User Observations
- Benchmarking (基准化分析法)

Tools for **Incremental Innovation** 渐进式创新
- Qualitative Surveys
- User Cases & Storyboards
- User Observations
- Benchmarking

Tools for **Breakthrough/Radical Innovation**
- Qualitative Surveys
- Quantitative Surveys
- User Cases & Storyboards
- User Observations
- User Led Creative Workshop

### Value Proposition
#### Jobs to be done 
- **Functional Jobs:** The task that customer want to achieve 
- **Emotional Jobs:** Customers want to feel about themselves or want to be perceived by others. 
- **Ancillary Jobs:** Other jobs that customers want to get done before, during and after they get their main job done 

#### Kano Model 

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_DIN/Kano Model.png" alt="Kano Model" style="zoom:67%;" />

#### Customer jobs

- **Customer jobs**: problems that they are trying to solve and the tasks the are trying to perform or complete.  ---- **Products/Services**
- **Pains**: the negative emotions and undesired costs, situations and risk which the customer could experience before, during and after getting the job is done.  ---- **Pain Reliever**
- **Gains**: the customer’s benefits and desires, and may span personal, functional, or economical etc.  ---- **Gain Creator**

**Summary**
- A value proposition is how your solution will meet customer needs. 
- A key method to create disruptive innovation is to uncover users hidden needs. 
- Products/services which cure users pains or enhances any benefits/emotional esteem are high value. 


# S4 Design Thinking

**Target**
**Linear Divergent/Convergent Design Process Model**: This session is to introduce the linear divergent/convergent approach. Several industrial cases will be discussed to demonstrate how this process is undertaken. 

### Linear Divergent/Convergent Design Process Model 
***Two-Part Linear Creative Design Process*** 

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_DIN/Linear Creative Design Process.png" alt="Linear Creative Design Process" style="zoom:67%;" />

### Focus Minds 
***Ensuring common understanding of project aims*** 
**Clarifying ambiguity** - All members of a NPD team can fully understand the concept 

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_DIN/Focus Minds.png" alt="Focus Minds" style="zoom:60%;" />

### What is Design Thinking

#### Solving the Right Problem

***There is no simple formula to describe Design Thinking.*** 

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_DIN/Design Thinking Process.png" alt="Design Thinking Process" style="zoom:67%;" />

There is no simple formula to describe Design Thinking. Design Thinking is a **human-centred approach** to drive innovation 

**Examples**:

- The elevator problem - Complex problems can have simple solutions 
- Abraham Wald - WWII study of damage to aircraft returning from missions by mathematician Abraham Wald 

#### Helps to define the problem 
***Divergent-convergent process - Double Diamond*** 
The Double Diamond is a visual tool developed by the UK Design Council to describe the process of design. 

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_DIN/Double Diamond.png" alt="Double Diamond" style="zoom:50%;" />

#### Where do good ideas come from

[Video: Where do good ideas come from - Steve Johnson](https://www.ted.com/talks/steven_johnson_where_good_ideas_come_from?language=en)

### Failing Early

#### Learn 
Failing early (and often) builds valuable insights and knowledge 
**Experimentation** - Deepens understanding which can lead to a ‘proof of concept’ prototype 

#### Time & Money 
It is much cheaper to fail or make changes early in a project 
The **Cost-Influence curve** - Prototyping early allows major design changes to be made at minimal cost 

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_DIN/The Cost-Influence curve.png" alt="The Cost-Influence curve" style="zoom:67%;" />

### Assessing Technology 

#### Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs)
**Technology maturity ->**
University:
1. Basic principles observed and reported 
2. Technology concept and/or application formulated 
3. Analytical and experimental critical function and/or characteristic proof-of-concept 

Somewhere:
4. Component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment 
5. Component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment 
6. System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment (ground or space) 
7. System prototype demonstration in a space environment 

Industey:
8. Actual system completed and “flight qualified” through test and demonstration (ground or space)
9. Actual system “flight proven” through successful mission operations 

#### Crossing the 'valley of Death'
TRLs – Understanding the TRL of a new innovation helps to build a picture of the risks, funding and other resources that will be needed for its full development 

<img src="/assets/img/Pic_DIN/Crossing the valley of Death.png" alt="Crossing the valley of Death" style="zoom:67%;" />

### Prototypes

#### Why Prototypes
**Mock-ups** 
When words are just not enough 
Getting ideas off paper - When an idea can no longer be expressed adequately in drawings or words 

**Resolve conflicts** 
Resolve conflicting ideas 
Benchmarking - Testing of simple prototypes can quickly resolve disputed ideas for even the most sophisticated machines 

**Project Funding**
Decision makers are more likely to back ideas supported by prototypes 
Feasibility - A prototype can demonstrate the feasibility of an idea as realistically as possible at the earliest possible stage

#### Classification 
Prototypes can be broadly classified into the following: 

- **Proof of principle** – testing of a aspect of a design (commonly referred to as a ‘breadboard’ in electronics) 
- **Form Study** – size, shape, look and feel (often non-functional) 
- **User experience** – research into human interaction (need to be robust) 
- **Visual** - capture the design aesthetic, colour, texture, etc (often non-functional) 
- **Functional (or 'Working')**  – most accurate representation of final design in appearance and function 
- **Virtual** - an increasingly important branch of prototyping able to simulate any of the above, with inherent advantages and disadvantages 

#### Making Prototypes

- **Hacking and 2.5D prototyping**
	Anything goes: Prototypes can be made from anything which allow an idea to be translated into reality
- **Rapid Prototyping (RP)**
	Two basic types: ‘additive’ and ‘subtractive’ – each has their strengths and weaknesses although Additive processes are becoming ever more versatile
